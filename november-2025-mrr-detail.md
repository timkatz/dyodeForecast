## Comparison to Your Actual November MRR

**Your Actual:** $288,000
**My Calculation:** $252,593
**Discrepancy:** +$35,407 (12.3% higher in actual)

**Note:** Glenmorangie is not included in monthly MRR ($0) but will have $22,500 accrued in January 2026 (quarterly advance). This doesn't affect November/December MRR but is important for 2026 revenue planning.

**Possible Missing Items:**
1. Additional ad-hoc or overage revenue not captured
2. Project billings I may have underestimated
3. Other revenue streams (support, training, consulting retainers)
4. Accrual adjustments or billing timing differences

Please review and identify what I'm missing.
