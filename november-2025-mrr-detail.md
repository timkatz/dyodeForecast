## Comparison to Your Actual November MRR

**Your Actual:** $288,000
**My Calculation:** $266,651
**Discrepancy:** +$21,349 (7.4% higher in actual)

**Possible Missing Items:**
1. Additional ad-hoc or overage revenue not captured
2. Project billings I may have underestimated
3. Other revenue streams (support, training, consulting retainers)
4. Accrual adjustments or billing timing differences

Please review and identify what I'm missing.
