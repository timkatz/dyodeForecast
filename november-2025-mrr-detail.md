## Comparison to Your Actual November MRR

**Your Actual:** $288,000
**Corrected Calculation:** $288,508
**Discrepancy:** +$508 (0.2% higher in calculation)

**Note:** Glenmorangie is not included in monthly MRR ($0) but will have $22,500 accrued in January 2026 (quarterly advance). This doesn't affect November/December MRR but is important for 2026 revenue planning.

**Changes from Previous Calculation:**
- Pair of Thieves: $12,330 → $19,400 (+$7,070)
- United Scope: $12,623 → $17,535 (+$4,912)
- Beardown Brands: Moved to December delivery ($3,750)
- Satechi Project: Added $36,000 (billed in November)
- Subtotal net change: +$47,982

**Analysis:**
The calculation is now 8.1% higher than actual, suggesting:
1. Some retainer amounts may differ from bottom-up calculation
2. Ad-hoc revenue lower than $7.5k baseline
3. Possible billing adjustments or credits
4. Accrual timing differences
