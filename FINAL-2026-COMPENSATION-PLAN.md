# DYODE 2026 Compensation Plan (FINAL)

**Approved:** December 2025
**Approach:** Company-wide sustainable growth (NO individual incentives)
**Goal:** Stabilize business, reward team appropriately, never repeat 2024-2025 whiplash

---

## Executive Summary

### What We're Doing:

**❌ NO Individual Incentive Programs:**
- No cross-sell commissions
- No referral credits
- No review credits
- Cross-sells/referrals/reviews are **expected job responsibilities**, not individually incentivized

**✅ Company-Wide Focus:**
- **SHORT-TERM:** Year-end performance bonuses (January 2027) based on 2026 full-year average margin
- **LONG-TERM:** Merit-based raises when we hit 12%+ margin for 3 consecutive quarters
- Everyone benefits when company succeeds

**Total Budget (Best Case):**
- Year-end bonuses (2027): ~$80k
- Raises (when unlock): ~$70-100k annual
- **Total: ~$150-180k over 2 years**

---

## Why This Approach?

### What Happened in 2024-2025:

**October 2024:**
- Hit profit margin goal for 2 consecutive quarters
- Gave raises to team
- **Thought we were on the right track**

**2025 Reality:**
- Q1: 1.3% margin
- Q2: 5.5% margin (improving!)
- Q3: 8.5% margin (almost to 10% goal!)
- Q4: 0.1% margin (**COLLAPSED back to breakeven**)

**Lesson Learned:**
- **2 consecutive quarters isn't enough to prove sustainability**
- Team experienced whiplash: raises given → frozen → anxiety
- After 12 layoffs, team needs stability, not more volatility

**2026 Approach:**
- More conservative: 3 consecutive quarters (not 2)
- Interim recognition: Year-end bonuses (not endless waiting)
- Unity: Everyone benefits together (not divisive individual programs)

---

## Part 1: Year-End Performance Bonuses (Short-Term Wins)

### Structure:

**Paid:** January 2027 (after full 2026 results are in)
**Based on:** 2026 full-year average profit margin
**Eligibility:** All employees

| 2026 Full-Year Avg Margin | Bonus Per Person | Total Cost (~40 people) |
|---------------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| 0-3% (no improvement) | $0 | $0 |
| 4-6% (modest improvement) | $400 | ~$16k |
| 7-9% (significant improvement) | $750 | ~$30k |
| 10-11% (close to goal) | $1,250 | ~$50k |
| 12%+ (goal achieved!) | $2,000 | ~$80k |

### Why This Works:

✅ **Rewards progress, not perfection**
- Even if you hit 8% average (not 12%), team gets $750
- Shows appreciation for improvement

✅ **Paid AFTER full year**
- No risk of giving bonus in July then collapsing in Q4 (like 2025)
- Conservative: results are final before payment

✅ **Gives team SOMETHING within 14 months**
- Oct 2024 raises → Jan 2027 bonus = 14 months
- Not "endless waiting" for raises

✅ **Graduated structure**
- Not all-or-nothing
- Every level of improvement recognized

✅ **One-time payment**
- Not permanent salary increase (lower risk than raises)

---

## Part 2: Merit-Based Raises (Long-Term Sustainability)

### Unlock Criteria (REVISED from 2024):

**OLD Criteria (2024):**
- 2 consecutive quarters at target → Gave raises
- **Result:** Had to freeze raises in 2025 when margins collapsed

**NEW Criteria (2026):**
- **3 consecutive quarters at 12%+ margin**
- OR **Full-year 2026 average of 12%+**

**Earliest Unlock Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Quarters That Hit 12%+ | Raises Effective |
|----------|----------------------|------------------|
| Best Case | Q2 + Q3 + Q4 2026 | January 2027 |
| Standard | Q3 + Q4 2026 + Q1 2027 | April 2027 |
| Alternative | Full-year 2026 avg 12%+ | January 2027 |

**Raise Structure:**
- 3-5% merit-based
- Performance-differentiated (top performers get 5%, average get 3%)
- Everyone eligible (commissions don't count against you)

---

## Combined Approach: Timeline for Team

### Throughout 2026:
- **Monthly town halls:** Transparent profit margin updates (10 min)
- **Quarterly reviews:** Progress check-ins
- **Public recognition:** Cross-sells, referrals, reviews (no individual commissions)

### January 2027:
- Calculate 2026 full-year average margin
- **Pay year-end bonuses** (graduated structure)
- Communicate progress toward raise unlock

### Q1-Q2 2027:
- If 3 consecutive quarters hit 12%+ → **Raises unlock**
- If not yet → Continue executing, reevaluate

---

### Scenario 3: Slow Start, Strong Finish

## Expected Job Responsibilities (Not Incentivized)

### What's Expected of Everyone:

**Project Managers:**
- Identify 2-3 cross-sell opportunities in 2026
- Generate 1-2 referrals
- Collect 1-2 Clutch reviews
- **This is part of your job**, not optional

**Marketing Team (Director + Manager):**
- Identify 3-4 cross-sell opportunities in 2026
- Generate 2-3 referrals
- Collect 2-3 Clutch reviews
- **This is part of your job**, not optional

**Director of Operations:**
- Close Martal SQLs and referrals (30-40% close rate)
- Build proposals at fair margins
- Control expenses

**All Directors:**
- Coach teams on cross-selling, referrals, reviews
- Improve processes and efficiency
- Enable sustainable growth

**Just like you're expected to:**
- Respond to emails promptly
