# DYODE 2025 Recap & 2026 Strategy
## Executive Summary for Management Team

**Prepared:** November 2025
**Audience:** Executive Management Team
**Confidentiality:** Management-level only — See "Information Sharing Guidelines" section for town hall guidance

---

## Important Context: Financial Transparency

**This document represents a new level of financial transparency for the management team.**

Historically, we've shared limited financial metrics with the team:
- Profit margin % (entire company)
- % to MRR goal (progress toward profitability targets)

This summary includes **MRR figures and strategic financial planning** that have not previously been shared broadly.

**Why we're sharing this now:**
- The management team needs complete visibility to lead effectively
- 2026 requires coordinated execution across all departments
- You need to understand the full picture to make informed decisions

**What this means:**
- Use this information to inform your team leadership
- Follow the "Information Sharing Guidelines" section for what to share at town halls
- Keep specific revenue/MRR figures confidential outside of management meetings

---

## Opening Message

**Team,**

2025 was a tough year. MRR declined from our $350k+ peak to $288.5k (Nov 2025). But the decline slowed significantly, and profit margins improved from 5.6% to 6.0%. We're stabilizing after three years of volatility.

**But here's the good news:** We have a clear, executable plan to grow MRR to $381k in 2026. That's 30% growth—ambitious but achievable with focused execution.

This document outlines:
- Where we are and what we learned in 2025
- Our 2026 growth strategy to hit $381k MRR
- Your specific role in making it happen
- How profit margins directly impact your stability (raises unlock at 12%+ margins)

**The bottom line:** Your focus on client retention, churn reduction, and margin improvement directly determines our success. Let's make 2026 our turnaround year.

— Tim & [Co-Founder Name]

## 2025: The Reality Check

### The Competitive Landscape Has Shifted

**Market Reality:**
- **Shopify agencies have proliferated:** When DYODE started, the partner ecosystem was smaller. Today: hundreds of agencies claim Shopify expertise.
- **Macro headwinds:** Inflation (2024), tariffs (2025), and AI disruption (2023-2025+) have made clients more cautious and budget-conscious.
- **Bigger, more sophisticated competitors:** Larger agencies with stronger brands, better content, and clearer positioning are dominating.

**What this means for DYODE:**
- We can't compete on services alone ("we do Shopify development + marketing") — that's what every agency says
- We need to position as **strategic partners**, not service vendors
- Prospects need content and thought leadership before they'll engage with us
- When our outbound efforts (Martal, ads, cold email) reach prospects, we're giving them little reason to engage if our website and materials look like every other agency
- Without differentiation, we're in commodity pricing battles that kill margins

**Our advantage:**
- **Tim and George are VP-level eCommerce strategists** from billion-dollar omnichannel retailers
- This is real, credible, rare — most agencies hire junior resources
- Mid-market eCommerce brands ($10M+) desperately need this level of strategic partnership
- **But no one knows about it** because we haven't built content, positioning, or sales assets around it

---

### The Numbers

**Current State (November 2025):**
- **MRR:** $288.5k
- **Active Clients:** 30 unique clients
- **Profit Margin:** 6.0% (accrual basis, up from 5.6% in 2024)

**3-Year MRR Trend:**
- 2022: ~$400k MRR (peak) - 8.5% profit margin
- 2023: ~$380k MRR (-5%) - 10.8% profit margin
- 2024: ~$330k MRR (-13%) - 5.6% profit margin
- 2025: ~$288.5k MRR (-12.5%, slowing) - 6.0% profit margin

**Key Insight:** Decline rate slowed from -13% (2024) to -11% (2025), and margins improved from 5.6% to 6.0%. This proves stabilization is possible with execution.

---

### What Went Wrong

**1. Churn is Killing Us**
- Current churn rate: 38-40% (20 of 53 unique clients lost)
- Industry benchmark: 15-20%
- **We're churning clients at 2x-2.5x the normal rate**

**2025 Churn:**
- Unique clients added: 13 | Unique clients lost: 20 | **Net: -7 clients**
- **Service-level MRR lost:** Development -$25k, Marketing -$65k, Consulting -$24k
- **Total Retainer MRR Lost: ~$115k**
- **Multi-service client retention: 100%** (only 1 of 4 multi-service clients experienced any loss)
- **See cofounders summary for detailed client-by-client breakdown**

**2. No Systematic Lead Generation**
- Tried multiple channels over the years: cold email, founder-led, Google Ads (March 2025, closed 4 clients but couldn't sustain past August), Meta/Instagram Ads and LinkedIn Ads (creative direction challenges prevented launch)
- Relied primarily on organic/inbound and referrals
- No predictable, consistent pipeline
- Feast or famine cycles

**3. Too Many Month-to-Month Contracts**
- 24% of MRR ($67k) has no contract protection
- Clients can leave anytime
- No predictability

**4. Project Dependency**
- 26% of revenue from projects
- Projects naturally end
- Not sustainable

**5. Economic Headwinds**
- Client budget freezes
- Tariffs and inflation
- Competitive pressure

---

### What We Did Right

**Launched Martal Partnership** (Nov 2025) - First systematic lead gen with 18 guaranteed SQLs
**Maintained Key Relationships** - AG Jeans, Great Star Tools, Glenmorangie still active
**Stabilized MRR** - Held at $290k in Q3-Q4, stopped the decline (temporarily)

---

## 2026: The Turnaround Plan

### The Goal

**Target MRR by End of 2026:** $381k (up from $288.5k today)

**What This Means:**
- 30% MRR growth needed
- Add $88k in net MRR (gross new MRR ~$200k, minus ~$115k churn)
- Replace lost clients PLUS expand with existing clients
- Stop decline and start growth trajectory

**Why It Matters to You:**
- At $381k MRR: Profit margins hit 12%+ sustainably
- At 12%+ margins: Raises unlock for all team members
- Timeline: Q2-Q4 2026 if we execute well

---

### The Strategy: Four Pillars

We're not relying on one silver bullet. We're building a diversified growth engine with four key programs:

---

#### **Pillar 1: Martal Lead Generation (External)**

**What:** Outsourced B2B lead gen partnership
**Status:** Pilot launched Nov 2025 (through Jan 2026)

**How It Works:**
- Martal does cold outreach to our ICP
- Delivers Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs)
- We close them

**2026 Target:**
- 8-10 new clients
- $60-75k MRR
- Close rate: 30-40%

**Your Role:**
- Sales team: Convert SQLs to clients
- Ops team: Support smooth onboarding
- Delivery teams: Ensure quality for retention

**Investment:** $18k/quarter (~$72k/year)
**Decision Point:** Jan 2026 (renew or pivot based on pilot results)

---

#### **Pillar 2: Client Referral Program (External)**

**What:** Clients earn 5-10% of first contract value in credits for referring new business

**Why This Matters:**
- Referrals have 60-80% close rate (vs. 30% other channels)
- Lowest CAC: $500-2k (vs. $5k+ Martal)
- Fastest sales cycle: 15-30 days
- Better client fit (referred by happy clients)

**How It Works:**
1. Client refers a brand
2. We close the deal
3. Client earns 5-10% credit (tiered by deal size)
4. Credit applies to future invoices

**2026 Target:**
- 5-8 referrals converting to clients
- $37-60k MRR impact
- Investment: $20-35k in credits

**Your Role:**
- Account managers: Ask for referrals in QBRs
- Sales team: Close referred leads quickly
- Marketing: Create referral materials

**Launch:** Jan 2026

---

#### **Pillar 3: Cross-Sell to Existing Clients (Internal)**

**The Opportunity:**
- 26 of 30 active clients (87%) only use ONE service
- 4 multi-service clients currently (13%)
- ~20-21 viable cross-sell targets

**Why This Matters (2025 Data):**
- **Multi-service client loss rate: 0%** (100% retention)
- **Single-service client loss rate: 43%**
- **Multi-service clients are 3.6x stickier** and more valuable
- **Real example:** Tipsy Elves lost Consulting but kept Development ($7.5k/mo MRR retained)

**How You Drive This:**
- Account managers: Identify opportunities when clients mention pain points
- Pitch additional services (dev, marketing, consulting)
- Hand off to sales team to close

**2026 Target:**
- 6-8 cross-sells
- $40-58k new MRR
- Higher retention = lower churn = better margins for you

**Launch:** Jan 2026

---

#### **Pillar 4: Clutch Reviews = Inbound Leads**

**Why This Matters:**
- Clutch reviews drive 30-40% of inbound leads
- Inbound leads = lower CAC and better conversion
- Social proof critical for Shopify Plus prospects
- Long-term asset (reviews stay live for years)

**The Ask:**
- Account managers: Ask happy clients to leave 4+ star reviews on Clutch
- Be specific: Ask after successful projects or milestone wins
- Make it easy: Offer to help write the review

**2026 Target:**
- 10-15 reviews
- Improved Clutch rating and visibility
- Drives inbound MRR without expensive ad spend

**Launch:** Jan 2026

---

#### **Strategic Priority: Maintain Shopify Plus Premier Partner Status**

**Current Status:** ⚠️ **AT RISK** - Only 1 Plus migration in past 2 years

**Why This Matters:**
- 61% of our MRR (~$180k) comes from Shopify/Plus clients
- Partner badge drives inbound leads and credibility
- Without Premier status: Lose competitive edge and co-marketing opportunities in 2027+

**What's Required:** We must meet **ALL THREE** criteria to maintain Premier tier:

| Criterion | Requirement | Current Status | 2026 Goal |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| **1. Merchant Revenue** | $2M-$10M | ✅ $200M-$1B+ | ✅ Already exceeds |
| **2. Plus Migrations** | 4 (2-year rolling) | ⚠️ Only 1 | Need 3+ more in 2026 |
| **3. Team Certifications** | 30 Shopify certs | ⚠️ 12 completed, 16 in-progress | Complete in-progress + 2-4 more |

**2026 Migration Targets (To Meet Criterion 2):**

| Quarter | Target | Cumulative | Project Revenue |
|---------|--------|------------|-----------------|
| Q1 | 1 migration | 1 | $75k |
| Q2 | 2 migrations | 3 | $150k |
| Q3 | 1 migration | 4 ✅ Premier | $75k |
| Q4 | 0-2 migrations | 4-6 | $0-150k |

**Current Pipeline:**
- Jerome's Furniture: ~$75k (Q1, re-engaging)
- Bolle Brands: ~$100-150k (Q2, rebuilding relationship)
- **Critical:** Martal must deliver 10-12 migration SQLs (not just general Shopify Plus leads)

**Platform Targets (What Counts as Migration):**
- ✅ BigCommerce → Shopify Plus
- ✅ Magento/Adobe Commerce → Shopify Plus
- ✅ WooCommerce → Shopify Plus
- ✅ Custom platforms → Shopify Plus
- ❌ Existing Shopify/Plus merchants (don't count)

---

**Certification Action Plan (To Meet Criterion 3):**

**Your Team Has Already Been Assigned Courses - We Just Need Completion!**

**Current Status:**
- ✅ **12 certifications completed** (40% to goal)
- ⚠️ **16 certifications in-progress** (assigned but not completed)
- 📊 **28 potential** (if all in-progress completed)
- **Gap: Just 2-4 more certifications needed to reach 30**

**Q1 2026 Action (Jan-Mar):**

All team members with assigned Shopify courses: **Complete your in-progress certifications**

| Team | Course | People | Priority |
|------|--------|--------|----------|
| **Dev Team** | Liquid Storefronts | 5 remaining | **HIGH** |
| **PM/Sales Team** | Selling Fundamentals | 4 remaining | **HIGH** |
| **Marketing Team** | Marketing Fundamentals | 3 (Lucas, Bruce, Jessica) | **MEDIUM** |
| **Marketing Team** | Selling/Positioning Marketing | 2 team members | **MEDIUM** |
| **PM Team** | Solution Planning | 1 (Elana) | **MEDIUM** |

**Time Required:** 4-6 hours per certification (courses are free)

**Q1 Target:** Complete 10-13 in-progress → 22-25 total certifications by March 31

**Q2 Target:** Complete remaining in-progress + co-founders/directors obtain 2-4 more → 30+ total certifications by June 30 ✅

**Why Both Matter:**
Even if we close 4 Plus migrations, we can still lose Premier tier if we don't reach 30 certifications by June 30, 2026. **Both requirements must be met.**

**Your Role:**
- **Sales Team:** Prioritize migration opportunities from Martal (BigCommerce, Magento, WooCommerce)
- **All Team Members with Assigned Courses:** Complete your Shopify certifications in Q1-Q2
- **Account Managers:** When prospecting/referring, prioritize platform migration opportunities
- **Management:** Track quarterly progress on both migrations closed and certifications completed

**Tracking:** Monthly updates on migration pipeline and certification completion

---

### How We Hit $381k MRR

**The MRR Math:**
- Current: $288.5k MRR
- New MRR needed: $92.5k (net, after ~$115k churn)
- Gross new MRR target: ~$207.5k
- Profit margin target at $381k: 12%+

| Channel | MRR Impact | Your Responsibility |
|---------|------------|---------------------|
| **Martal Lead Gen** | $60-75k | Sales team closes SQLs |
| **Client Referrals** | $37-60k | Account managers ask |
| **Cross-Sells** | $40-58k | Account managers pitch |
| **Founder-led** | $45-60k | Co-founders close |
| **Inbound (Reviews)** | $15-22k | Account managers + Marketing |
| **GROSS NEW MRR** | **$197-275k** | Everyone contributes |
| **Less: Churn** | **-$115k** | Retention is your control |
| **NET MRR GROWTH** | **$82-160k** | Targets $381k MRR |

### Strategic Investment: Market Positioning & Content

**The Reality:** Your outbound efforts (Martal, ads, cold email, founder-led) will only work effectively if prospects find compelling content when they research DYODE.

**What's being built (2026):**

1. **Strategic Positioning Framework**
   - Why DYODE is different: VP-level eCommerce expertise (not just "we do Shopify")
   - Founder credibility story: Billion-dollar omnichannel retail experience
   - Message alignment across all channels

2. **Problem-Specific Landing Pages** (Tied to your outbound campaigns)
   - "The Migration Trap" (BigCommerce → Shopify Plus)
   - "Shopify Plus for Mid-Market"
   - "Email Marketing Strategy for Shopify"
   - Each with relevant case studies, frameworks, CTAs

3. **Thought Leadership Content**
   - Blog series: "VP Perspective on [Topic]"
   - Resource guides and frameworks
   - Case study library showcasing results
   - Video case studies in founder voice

4. **Website Redesign**
   - Reflects strategic positioning (not "here's what we do")
   - Drives visitors to relevant landing pages based on their problems
   - Builds credibility through content + founder expertise

**Why this matters for your role:**
- When you send a cold email or referral partner directs someone to DYODE, landing page should reflect strategic thinking (not commodity positioning)
- When Martal delivers a lead and they Google you, website should reinforce "strategic partner" narrative
- When prospects evaluate you vs. competitors, content should demonstrate founder expertise and strategic framework thinking
- Better positioning = Higher conversion rates = Your cross-sells and referrals close faster

**Investment:** $54-90k for Phase 1 (positioning + foundation content)

**Timeline:** Jan-June 2026

---

### Compensation & Recognition

**Cross-Sell Commissions:**
- 5% of contract term value
- Paid 50% at signing, 50% after 90 days
- Average AM potential: $5-10k/year
- Top performers: $15k+

**Recognition:**
- Monthly shoutouts for top performers
- Quarterly awards
- Public recognition in team meetings
- Annual recognition for year-end leaders

**NO cash for referral/review asks** — those are client credits, but you'll be recognized for driving growth.

## Q1 2026: The Critical Quarter

**Why Q1 is Make-or-Break:**
- $60k in projects ending (but Satechi converting to retainer April!) ✅
- $39k in contracts expiring (Dec expirations need renewal focus)
- Need to close 7-9 new clients (aggressive but achievable)
- **Shopify certifications:** Must complete 10-13 in-progress courses to stay on track for Premier tier
- Sets momentum for entire year

**Recent Wins Going Into Q1:**
- ✅ Poseidon Bikes renewed for 12 months (10/28/25)
- ✅ Align Tech renewed for 6 months (9/25/25)
- ✅ Satechi confirmed converting to retainer 4/1/26
- ✅ 12 Shopify certifications completed (40% to Premier goal)
- **$23k MRR risk removed** - Q1 is more achievable than originally forecast!

**Q1 Critical Actions:**

**Week 1-2 (Late November/Early December):**
- [ ] Launch cross-sell, referral, and review programs
- [ ] **All team members: Begin completing assigned Shopify certifications**
- [ ] Sales: Re-engage Jerome's Furniture migration opportunity
- [ ] Sales: Schedule Bolle Brands check-in (Q2 migration)

**January:**
- [ ] First Martal SQLs arrive - prioritize migration opportunities
- [ ] Account managers: Identify top 3 cross-sell opportunities each
- [ ] **Dev team: Complete 5 remaining Liquid Storefronts certifications (HIGH PRIORITY)**
- [ ] **PM/Sales team: Complete 4 remaining Selling Fundamentals certifications (HIGH PRIORITY)**

**February:**
- [ ] Close 1st Plus migration (Q1 target)
- [ ] First cross-sells close
- [ ] First referrals submitted
- [ ] First Clutch reviews go live
- [ ] **Marketing team: Complete Marketing Fundamentals certifications (3 people)**

**March:**
- [ ] Push to close Q1 deals
- [ ] Review Martal pilot results (renew decision)
- [ ] **Complete remaining in-progress certifications → 22-25 total by March 31**

**If Q1 fails:**
- Start Q2 behind target
- Harder to catch up
- Morale impact
- **Risk losing Premier tier if certifications fall behind schedule**

**If Q1 succeeds:**
- Momentum builds
- Team confidence
- Easier path to year-end goal
- **On track for 30+ certifications by June 30** ✅

**All hands on deck for Q1.**

## Addressing the Elephant in the Room

### "Why should we believe this will work?"

**Fair question. Here's why:**

1. **Multiple channels reduce risk**
   - Not relying on one thing (Martal)
   - If one underperforms, others compensate

2. **All programs are performance-based**
   - We only pay when results happen
   - Low risk, high reward

3. **We're leveraging existing assets**
   - 30 active clients underutilized
   - Referrals and cross-sells tap into that

4. **Proven models**
   - Referrals: 60-80% close rate (industry standard)
   - Cross-sells: Multi-service clients have 0% loss rate vs. 46% for single-service
   - Project→Retainer: Satechi converting (our model works!)
   - Reviews: Standard agency growth tactic

5. **We have a plan AND resources**
   - Not winging it
   - $107-130k investment approved
   - Training and support provided

---

### "What if we miss the target?"

**Honest answer:** If we execute and still miss, at least we'll know we tried everything.

**But here's the reality:** If we do NOTHING different in 2026, we'll continue declining in MRR. Without new business, we'll drop toward $270-280k MRR by end of 2026, with cash flow increasingly tight.

**This plan gives us a fighting chance.**

And even if we hit $360k MRR instead of $381k, that's still meaningful growth and better than continued decline.

---

## What We Need From You

### 1. **Belief and Commitment**

This only works if everyone is bought in. We need:

## Information Sharing Guidelines

### What to Share at Monthly Town Halls (Entire Team)

**DO share these metrics and updates:**

✅ **Performance against goals (percentages, not dollars):**
- "We're at 85% of our MRR goal for the month"
- "We've closed 3 new clients this quarter toward our target of 8-10"
- "We're tracking toward our annual growth target"

✅ **Client wins and losses (counts, not dollars):**
- "We added 2 new clients this month: [Client A] and [Client B]"
- "We lost 1 client to budget cuts"
- "We're at 32 active clients (up from 30 in November)"

✅ **Program launches and participation:**
- "The referral program is now live — ask your account managers how to participate"
- "We've received 5 Clutch reviews this quarter (target: 10-15)"
- "3 successful cross-sells completed in Q1"

✅ **Strategic initiatives (without financial details):**
- "We're working with Martal to generate qualified leads"
- "We're focusing on Shopify Plus projects to maintain our partner status"
- "We're targeting improved retention through QBRs"

✅ **Team recognition:**
- "Sarah landed a $7.5k/month cross-sell with Great Star Tools"
- "Mike generated 2 referrals that converted to new clients"
- "The team delivered 12 Clutch reviews this quarter"

✅ **What's working and what's not:**
- "Referrals are converting at 70% — keep them coming"
- "We need to improve our renewal outreach process"
- "Martal is delivering quality leads; sales team is closing them well"

### What to Keep in Management Meetings Only

❌ **DO NOT share at town halls:**

- **Specific revenue figures:** "$4.2M annual revenue," "$292k MRR"
- **Specific MRR targets:** "We need $381k MRR by year-end"
- **Client-level financials:** "AG Jeans pays us $15k/month"
- **Investment amounts:** "We're spending $72k/year on Martal"
- **Profit margins (absolute dollars):** "We're making $500k profit"
- **Individual client risk assessments:** "Wyze might reduce spend"
- **Churn rates (percentages):** "35% annual churn" (just say "higher than we'd like")
- **Historical revenue decline details:** "Down $1.66M over 3 years" (just say "recovering from recent decline")

## Final Thoughts

**We're not going to sugarcoat it:** 2025 was rough. Three years of MRR decline from ~$400k to $288.5k has put us in a tough spot. The good news: the decline slowed from -13% (2024) to -12.5% (2025), and profit margins improved from 5.6% to 6.0%.

**But we're not giving up.** We have a plan, we have resources, and we have a team capable of executing.

**2026 is our turnaround year.** It won't be easy. It'll require focus, urgency, and teamwork.

**But we can do this.**

Let's go make it happen.

## Appendix: FAQ
