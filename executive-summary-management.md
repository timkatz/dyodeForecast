# DYODE 2025 Recap & 2026 Strategy
## Executive Summary for Management Team

**Prepared:** November 2025
**Audience:** Executive Management Team
**Confidentiality:** Management-level only — See "Information Sharing Guidelines" section for town hall guidance

---

## Important Context: Financial Transparency

**This document represents a new level of financial transparency for the management team.**

Historically, we've shared limited financial metrics with the team:
- Profit margin % (entire company)
- % to MRR goal (progress toward profitability targets)

This summary includes **full revenue details, MRR figures, and strategic financial planning** that have not previously been shared broadly.

**Why we're sharing this now:**
- The management team needs complete visibility to lead effectively
- 2026 requires coordinated execution across all departments
- You need to understand the full picture to make informed decisions

**What this means:**
- Use this information to inform your team leadership
- Follow the "Information Sharing Guidelines" section for what to share at town halls
- Keep specific revenue/MRR figures confidential outside of management meetings

---

## Opening Message

**Team,**

2025 was a tough year. We're down 20% in revenue, sitting at $3.2M vs. $4M in 2024. After three years of decline from our $4.86M peak, we're at a critical juncture.

**But here's the good news:** We have a clear, executable plan for 2026 that will reverse the trend.

This document outlines:
- Where we are and how we got here
- Our 2026 growth strategy
- Your role in making it happen
- The resources and support you'll have

**The bottom line:** If we execute with focus and urgency, we can hit $4.2M in 2026 and get back on a growth trajectory. It won't be easy, but it's absolutely achievable.

Let's make 2026 our turnaround year.

## 2025: The Reality Check

### The Numbers

**Current State (November 2025):**
- MRR: $292,946
- Active Clients: 30 unique clients
- Projected 2025 Revenue: $3.1-3.2M

**3-Year Decline:**
- 2022: $4.86M (peak)
- 2023: $4.71M (-3%)
- 2024: $4.00M (-15%)
- 2025: $3.2M (-20%)

**We've lost $1.66M in revenue over 3 years.**

---

### What Went Wrong

**1. Churn is Killing Us**
- Current churn rate: 35-40%
- Industry benchmark: 15-20%
- **We're churning clients at 2x the normal rate**

**2025 Churn:**
- Clients added: 13
- Clients lost: 22
- **Net: -9 clients**

**2. No Systematic Lead Generation**
- Relied on organic/referrals only until Nov 2025
- No predictable pipeline
- Feast or famine cycles

**3. Too Many Month-to-Month Contracts**
- 24% of MRR ($67k) has no contract protection
- Clients can leave anytime
- No predictability

**4. Project Dependency**
- 26% of revenue from projects
- Projects naturally end
- Not sustainable

**5. Economic Headwinds**
- Client budget freezes
- Tariffs and inflation
- Competitive pressure

---

### What We Did Right

**Launched Martal Partnership (Nov 2025)**
- First systematic lead gen effort
- 18 guaranteed SQLs over 3 months
- Results pending, but pipeline building

**Maintained Key Relationships**
- AG Jeans, Great Star Tools, Glenmorangie still active
- Strong delivery reputation intact

**Stabilized in Q3-Q4**
- MRR held around $290k
- Stopped the bleeding (temporarily)

---

## 2026: The Turnaround Plan

### The Goal

**Target:** $4.2M revenue, $381k MRR by end of 2026

**What This Means:**
- 46% MRR growth needed
- Add $209k in new MRR
- Replace 100% of churned clients PLUS grow
- Reverse 3-year decline trend

**This is ambitious but achievable.**

---

### The Strategy: Four Pillars

We're not relying on one silver bullet. We're building a diversified growth engine with four key programs:

---

#### **Pillar 1: Martal Lead Generation (External)**

**What:** Outsourced B2B lead gen partnership
**Status:** Pilot launched Nov 2025 (through Jan 2026)

**How It Works:**
- Martal does cold outreach to our ICP
- Delivers Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs)
- We close them

**2026 Target:**
- 8-10 new clients
- $60-75k MRR
- Close rate: 30-40%

**Your Role:**
- Sales team: Convert SQLs to clients
- Ops team: Support smooth onboarding
- Delivery teams: Ensure quality for retention

**Investment:** $18k/quarter (~$72k/year)
**Decision Point:** Jan 2026 (renew or pivot based on pilot results)

---

#### **Pillar 2: Client Referral Program (External)**

**What:** Clients earn 5-10% of first contract value in credits for referring new business

**Why This Matters:**
- Referrals have 60-80% close rate (vs. 30% other channels)
- Lowest CAC: $500-2k (vs. $5k+ Martal)
- Fastest sales cycle: 15-30 days
- Better client fit (referred by happy clients)

**How It Works:**
1. Client refers a brand
2. We close the deal
3. Client earns 5-10% credit (tiered by deal size)
4. Credit applies to future invoices

**2026 Target:**
- 5-8 referrals converting to clients
- $250-400k revenue impact
- Investment: $20-35k in credits

**Your Role:**
- Account managers: Ask for referrals in QBRs
- Sales team: Close referred leads quickly
- Marketing: Create referral materials

**Launch:** Jan 2026

---

#### **Pillar 3: Cross-Sell Incentive Program (Internal)**

**What:** Account managers earn 5% commission on contract value for cross-selling additional services to existing clients

**The Opportunity:**
- 27 of 30 clients (90%) only use ONE service
- ~20 viable cross-sell targets
- Multi-service clients have 50-70% higher retention

**How It Works:**
1. AM identifies cross-sell opportunity
2. AM pitches additional service (marketing, dev, consulting)
3. Client signs contract
4. AM earns 5% commission (50% at signing, 50% after 90 days)

**Example:**
- Cross-sell marketing to dev client: $7,500/month x 6-month contract
- AM earns: $2,250 commission

**2026 Target:**
- 6-8 cross-sells
- $40-58k new MRR
- Investment: $10-16k in commissions

**Your Role:**
- Account managers: Identify and pitch opportunities (PRIMARY)
- Delivery teams: Ensure quality cross-sell delivery
- Sales team: Support proposal/closing process

**Launch:** Jan 2026

---

#### **Pillar 4: Clutch Review Incentive (External)**

**What:** Clients earn $500 credit for leaving qualified Clutch review

**Why This Matters:**
- Clutch reviews drive 30-40% of inbound leads
- Social proof critical for Shopify Plus prospects
- Long-term asset (reviews stay live for years)

**How It Works:**
1. Client leaves 4+ star review on Clutch (100+ words, specific examples)
2. Review goes live
3. Client earns $500 credit on next invoice

**2026 Target:**
- 10-15 reviews
- Improved Clutch rating and visibility
- Investment: $5-7.5k in credits

**Your Role:**
- Account managers: Ask happy clients for reviews (PRIMARY)
- Marketing: Track reviews and manage Clutch profile
- Delivery teams: Create review-worthy results

**Launch:** Jan 2026

---

### The Math: How We Hit $4.2M

| Channel | New Clients | MRR Impact | Investment | Your Role |
|---------|-------------|------------|------------|-----------|
| **Martal** | 8-10 | $60-75k | $72k | Sales closes |
| **Referrals** | 5-8 | $37-60k | $20-35k | AMs ask |
| **Cross-Sells** | 6-8 (expansions) | $40-58k | $10-16k | AMs pitch |
| **Founder-led** | 6-8 | $45-60k | Time | Co-founders |
| **Inbound (Clutch)** | 2-3 | $15-22k | $5-7.5k | Marketing + AMs ask for reviews |
| **TOTAL** | **27-37** | **$197-275k** | **$107-130k** | **Everyone** |

**After accounting for churn (~$112k), we net $85-163k growth → $377-435k MRR**

**All hands on deck for Q1.**

---

## Addressing the Elephant in the Room

### "Why should we believe this will work?"

**Fair question. Here's why:**

1. **Multiple channels reduce risk**
   - Not relying on one thing (Martal)
   - If one underperforms, others compensate

2. **All programs are performance-based**
   - We only pay when results happen
   - Low risk, high reward

3. **We're leveraging existing assets**
   - 30 active clients underutilized
   - Referrals and cross-sells tap into that

4. **Proven models**
   - Referrals: 60-80% close rate (industry standard)
   - Cross-sells: Existing happy clients, natural expansion
   - Reviews: Standard agency growth tactic

5. **We have a plan AND resources**
   - Not winging it
   - $107-130k investment approved
   - Training and support provided

---

### "What if we miss the target?"

**Honest answer:** If we execute and still miss, at least we'll know we tried everything.

**But here's the reality:** If we do NOTHING different in 2026, we'll continue declining at 20%/year. That puts us at $2.5M by end of 2026.

**This plan gives us a fighting chance.**

And even if we hit $3.8M instead of $4.2M, that's still better than $2.5M.

---

## What We Need From You

### 1. **Belief and Commitment**

This only works if everyone is bought in. We need:
- Active participation (not passive)
- Positive energy (not cynicism)
- Team mentality (not siloed)

---

### 2. **Focus on Execution**

Ideas don't drive revenue. Execution does.
- Follow the process
- Track your metrics
- Ask for help when stuck
- Iterate and improve

---

### 3. **Urgency**

We don't have time to waste. Q1 sets the tone.
- Move fast
- Don't overthink
- Action > perfection

---

### 4. **Accountability**

Own your role in the strategy.
- AMs: Cross-sells, referrals, reviews
- Sales: Close rates
- Marketing: Program support
- Delivery: Quality and retention

**We'll track metrics publicly. Everyone will see who's driving results.**

---

## The Upside

**If we hit our targets:**
- $4.2M revenue (vs. $3.2M in 2025)
- 46% MRR growth
- Reverse 3-year decline
- Stronger client base (43-48 clients vs. 30)
- Diversified lead sources (less feast/famine)
- Team morale boost
- Bonuses and commissions for all

**For you personally:**
- Job security (growing company vs. declining)
- Career growth (more opportunities)
- Commission potential (AMs)
- Pride in being part of turnaround

---

## Information Sharing Guidelines

### What to Share at Monthly Town Halls (Entire Team)

**DO share these metrics and updates:**

✅ **Performance against goals (percentages, not dollars):**
- "We're at 85% of our MRR goal for the month"
- "We've closed 3 new clients this quarter toward our target of 8-10"
- "We're tracking toward our annual growth target"

✅ **Client wins and losses (counts, not dollars):**
- "We added 2 new clients this month: [Client A] and [Client B]"
- "We lost 1 client to budget cuts"
- "We're at 32 active clients (up from 30 in November)"

✅ **Program launches and participation:**
- "The referral program is now live — ask your account managers how to participate"
- "We've received 5 Clutch reviews this quarter (target: 10-15)"
- "3 successful cross-sells completed in Q1"

✅ **Strategic initiatives (without financial details):**
- "We're working with Martal to generate qualified leads"
- "We're focusing on Shopify Plus projects to maintain our partner status"
- "We're targeting improved retention through QBRs"

✅ **Team recognition:**
- "Sarah landed a $7.5k/month cross-sell with Great Star Tools"
- "Mike generated 2 referrals that converted to new clients"
- "The team delivered 12 Clutch reviews this quarter"

✅ **What's working and what's not:**
- "Referrals are converting at 70% — keep them coming"
- "We need to improve our renewal outreach process"
- "Martal is delivering quality leads; sales team is closing them well"

---

### What to Keep in Management Meetings Only

❌ **DO NOT share at town halls:**

- **Specific revenue figures:** "$4.2M annual revenue," "$292k MRR"
- **Specific MRR targets:** "We need $381k MRR by year-end"
- **Client-level financials:** "AG Jeans pays us $15k/month"
- **Investment amounts:** "We're spending $72k/year on Martal"
- **Profit margins (absolute dollars):** "We're making $500k profit"
- **Individual client risk assessments:** "Wyze might reduce spend"
- **Churn rates (percentages):** "35% annual churn" (just say "higher than we'd like")
- **Historical revenue decline details:** "Down $1.66M over 3 years" (just say "recovering from recent decline")

---

## Final Thoughts

**We're not going to sugarcoat it:** 2025 was rough. Three years of decline has put us in a tough spot.

**But we're not giving up.** We have a plan, we have resources, and we have a team capable of executing.

**2026 is our turnaround year.** It won't be easy. It'll require focus, urgency, and teamwork.

**But we can do this.**

Let's go make it happen.

## Appendix: FAQ

**Q: What if a client says no to a cross-sell?**
A: That's fine. Don't push. Move on to next target. Not every client is a fit.

**Q: How do I know which clients to ask for referrals?**
A: Happy clients, well-connected, engaged. We'll help you identify them in training.

**Q: What if Martal fails?**
A: We'll pivot. Referrals and cross-sells compensate. May hire in-house sales exec.

**Q: Can I earn commission on referrals?**
A: No, referral credits go to the CLIENT (not you). But you get recognized for driving them.

**Q: What if I don't hit my cross-sell target?**
A: No penalty. It's a bonus opportunity, not a requirement. But top performers will be recognized.

**Q: When do commissions get paid?**
A: 50% at contract signing, 50% after 90-day retention milestone.

**Q: What if a cross-sold client churns within 90 days?**
A: Commission is clawed back (50% returned). Focus on quality fits.

**Q: How much time will this take?**
A: Cross-sells: 2-3 hours per pitch. Referral asks: 5 minutes in QBR. Review asks: 5 minutes after success.

**More questions? Ask in training or Slack!**
