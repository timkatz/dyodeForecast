## Email Templates

### 1. Internal Announcement to Account Managers

**SUBJECT:** New 2026 Growth Programs — Earn More Through Performance

**To:** All Account Managers
**From:** Tim Katz & George, Co-Founders
**Date:** December 9, 2025

---

**Team,**

As we head into 2026, I want to share three new growth programs that will help us hit our revenue targets — **and give you opportunities to earn more through performance-based incentives.**

Given the current salary freeze, I wanted to create meaningful ways for you to increase your compensation by driving results that matter. Here's what we're launching:

---

### **1. Cross-Sell Incentive Program (For AMs)**

**What it is:**
You'll earn **5% commission** on the contract value of any cross-sell you identify and close with your existing clients.

**Examples:**
- You cross-sell marketing to a dev client → $7,500/month x 6-month contract = $2,250 commission
- You cross-sell consulting → $10,000/month x 3-month contract = $1,500 commission
- You cross-sell development to a marketing client → $8,000/month x 6-month contract = $2,400 commission

**How it works:**
- You identify a cross-sell opportunity with a client you manage
- You pitch the additional service
- Client signs contract
- You earn 5% (50% at signing, 50% after 90 days)

**Why this matters:**
90% of our clients only use ONE service. That's a massive opportunity. You know these clients best — their challenges, goals, and needs. This is your chance to expand the relationship AND earn extra income.

**Important:** Not all clients are viable targets. We've identified clients who previously tried and stopped services (like Wyze, Tori Richard, United Scope). Check the past-service-history.md document before pitching. Focus on clean opportunities.

**Action:** By Dec 13, identify your top 3 cross-sell opportunities. We'll review together and strategize approach.

---

### **2. Client Referral Program (For Clients — You Facilitate)**

**What it is:**
Clients who refer new business to DYODE earn **5-10% of the first contract value in service credits**.

**Examples:**
- Client refers brand → $60k contract signed → Client earns $4,800 credit
- Client refers brand → $40k contract signed → Client earns $2,800 credit

**Your role:**
- Mention the referral program in QBRs and check-ins
- Ask: "Do you know any brands struggling with their dev agency?"
- Track referrals in CRM (gives you credit for facilitation)
- Follow up when referrals convert

**Why this matters:**
Referrals have 60-80% close rates (vs. 30% for other channels) and close faster. Every referral you help facilitate makes your client happier AND brings in high-quality leads.

**Action:** By Dec 13, identify 5 clients most likely to refer (happy, well-connected, engaged).

---

### **3. Clutch Review Program (For Clients — You Ask)**

**What it is:**
Clients who leave a qualified Clutch review earn a **$500 service credit**.

**Your role:**
- Ask happy clients to leave a Clutch review
- Send them the link and explain the incentive
- Follow up after they submit
- Track in CRM

**Why this matters:**
Clutch reviews drive 30-40% of our inbound leads. More reviews = more credibility = more closes. This is one of the easiest ways to drive growth.

**Action:** By Dec 13, identify 3-5 clients who would leave great reviews (happy, articulate, specific results).

---

### **Training Session: December 11, 2:00 PM**

We'll do a 90-minute training to cover:
- How to identify cross-sell opportunities
- Cross-sell pitch templates and objection handling
- How to ask for referrals and reviews without being pushy
- CRM tracking and credit/commission process
- Q&A

**Come prepared with:**
- Your top 3 cross-sell targets
- Your top 5 referral-likely clients
- Your top 3-5 review candidates

---

### **What Success Looks Like in 2026**

If we execute on these programs:
- **Cross-sells:** 6-8 expansions = $40-58k new MRR
- **Referrals:** 5-8 new clients = $250-400k revenue
- **Reviews:** 10-15 Clutch reviews = stronger inbound pipeline

**For you personally:**
- Average AM could earn **$5,000 - $10,000 in cross-sell commissions** in 2026
- Top performers could earn **$15,000+**
- You'll have happier clients (more services = higher retention)
- You'll contribute directly to company growth

---

### **Important Notes**

**Cross-Sell Rules:**
- You must get co-founders' approval BEFORE pitching (to avoid conflicts)
- Check past-service-history.md first
- Focus on clients where it's a genuine fit, not a hard sell
- 60-day clawback if client churns (so focus on quality)

**Referral/Review Rules:**
- Don't be pushy — these should feel natural in conversation
- Only ask happy clients (don't risk relationships)
- Track everything in CRM

**Questions?**
Reply to this email or ask during the training session.

---

**Bottom line:**
These programs give you control over your compensation while helping us hit our 2026 goals. Let's make it a great year.

— Tim

## Conversation Scripts for Account Managers

### Script 1: Asking for Referrals (During QBR)

**Context:** Monthly or quarterly business review, after discussing performance

---

**Setup:**
"By the way, we just launched a referral program that I wanted to mention..."

**The Ask:**
"Do you know any eCommerce brands — maybe in your network or industry — that are struggling with their dev agency or looking for a new partner?

If you refer them and they sign a contract, we'll credit you **5-10% of their first contract value** toward your services. So for example, if they sign a $60k contract, you'd earn close to $5,000 in credits.

It's our way of saying thank you for connecting us with great brands."

**Listen for response:**

**If interested:**
"Great! Who comes to mind? Just give me their name and intro, and I'll handle the rest. You don't need to do any selling — just make the connection."

**If they mention someone:**
"Perfect. Would you mind intro'ing us via email? Or I can reach out directly and mention you sent me. What works better?"

**If not sure:**
"No problem! Just keep it in mind. If anyone mentions they're looking for dev or marketing help, send them my way. Here's a one-pager with the details." [Send PDF]

---

### Script 2: Asking for Clutch Reviews (After Successful Deliverable)

**Context:** After launching a feature, completing a project milestone, or getting positive feedback

---

**Setup:**
"I'm really glad [feature/project/result] worked out well..."

**The Ask:**
"Would you be open to sharing your experience working with us on Clutch? It's one of the main places brands go to find agencies, and your review would help other companies make informed decisions.

To thank you for taking the time, we'll apply a **$500 credit** to your next invoice."

**Listen for response:**

**If yes:**
"Awesome, thank you! It takes about 10 minutes. I'll send you the Clutch link right after this call. Just make sure to include some specifics — like [mention a result or experience] — and honest feedback. Even constructive criticism is helpful.

Once it's live, just reply to my email and we'll apply the credit."

**If hesitant:**
"No pressure at all! If you'd prefer to do it later when you have time, totally fine. Just let me know."

**If they want to think about it:**
"Of course! Take your time. I'll send you the link and details via email, and you can do it whenever works for you."

---

### Script 3: Cross-Sell Pitch (Dev → Marketing Example)

**Context:** Client has strong dev relationship, site is performing well

---

**Setup:**
"I noticed [website traffic has grown 30%] / [you launched several new features this quarter]. That's great momentum..."

**Identify the Gap:**
"Are you seeing similar lift in conversions and revenue? Or is there a gap between the traffic you're driving and what's actually converting?"

**Listen for response.**

**If they mention challenges (email performance, paid ads, etc.):**
"That's actually something our marketing team specializes in — specifically for Shopify Plus brands like yours. We've helped clients like [similar brand] turn traffic into revenue with targeted email campaigns and paid social.

Would it be worth having a conversation about what that might look like for [their brand]? I can intro you to our marketing lead and we can put together a proposal."

**If they're interested:**
"Great. Let me set up a 30-minute call with [marketing lead]. No obligation — just to explore what's possible and see if it makes sense."

**If not interested:**
"No worries! Just wanted to mention it since it's a natural next step. If it ever becomes a priority, let me know."

## Integration with Overall 2026 Strategy

### How These Programs Support 2026 Goals

**Goal:** $4.2M revenue, $381k MRR by end of 2026

**Without These Programs:**
- Need 21-24 new clients entirely from Martal + founder-led
- Cross-sell pool of 21 clients = lower conversion without incentive
- No systematic referral engine
- Clutch reviews happen organically (slow)

**With These Programs:**

| Program | Contribution | Impact |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| **Cross-Sells** | $40-58k MRR | 19-24% of new business target |
| **Referrals** | 5-8 clients, $250-400k | 20-30% of client acquisition |
| **Reviews** | 10-15 reviews | 30-40% more inbound leads |

**Combined Effect:**
- More diversified lead sources (less Martal dependence)
- Lower overall CAC (referrals + cross-sells cheaper)
- Higher close rates (referrals + social proof)
- Stronger client relationships (AMs more engaged)

---

### Timeline Integration

| Month | Cross-Sell | Referral | Review | Other Initiatives |
|-------|------------|----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Dec 2025** | Internal prep | Internal prep | Internal prep | Martal Month 2, end-of-year renewals |
| **Jan 2026** | Soft launch (2 targets) | Soft launch (top 10) | Soft launch (top 10) | Martal Month 3, contract renewals |
| **Feb 2026** | Full launch (all targets) | Full launch (all clients) | Full launch (all clients) | Martal pilot ends, Q1 push |
| **Mar 2026** | Review Q1 results | Review Q1 results | Review Q1 results | Q1 performance review |
| **Apr-Dec 2026** | Ongoing execution | Quarterly reminders | Quarterly reminders | Martal renewal decision, ongoing growth |

---

## Risk Factors & Mitigation

### Risk 1: AMs Don't Prioritize Programs

**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**
- Make commissions meaningful ($5-10k potential)
- Track and report performance publicly (healthy competition)
- Recognize top performers monthly
- Tie to annual performance reviews

---

### Risk 2: Clients Feel "Sold To"

**Probability:** Low-Medium
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Train AMs on natural, non-pushy approach
- Only ask happy clients
- Position as "helping their network" not "selling"
- Don't ask multiple times if they decline

---

### Risk 3: Program Complexity Confuses Clients

**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Keep client emails simple (one-pagers, clear examples)
- AMs explain verbally in QBRs
- FAQ document available
- Personal follow-up if confusion

---

### Risk 4: Low Initial Participation

**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Start with soft launch (build momentum)
- Share early wins to motivate others
- Personal outreach vs. just email blasts
- Quarterly reminders keep it top-of-mind
