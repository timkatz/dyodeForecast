# 2026 Growth Programs: Account Manager Guide

**For:** Account Management Team
**From:** Tim Katz & George, Co-Founders
**Date:** December 2025
**Purpose:** Your roadmap to earning $5-15k+ in commissions while driving DYODE's growth

---

## What This Means for You

During our salary freeze, we've created three performance-based programs that put significant earning potential directly in your hands:

**Your Earning Opportunity in 2026:**
- **Cross-Sell Commissions:** $5-10k per AM (top performers: $12-15k+)
- **Referral Credits:** Tradeable or stackable for personal services
- **Review Credits:** Additional $500-1,500 in credits
- **Total Potential:** $5-15k+ in combined earnings/credits

**Bottom Line:** If you successfully cross-sell 2 clients, generate 2-3 referrals, and collect 3-5 reviews, you're looking at $8-12k in commissions/credits — **more than most raises** during a salary freeze.

---

## The Three Programs (Quick Overview)

### 1. Cross-Sell Commission Program
**What:** 5% commission on contract term value when you cross-sell dev to marketing clients or marketing to dev clients

**Earnings Example:**
- You pitch development to one of your marketing clients
- They sign a $7,500/month retainer for 6 months = $45,000 contract
- **You earn: $2,250 commission** (5% of $45,000)

**Target:** 2 cross-sells per AM = $4,000-6,000 in commissions

---

### 2. Client Referral Credit Program
**What:** 5-10% service credit when you get a client to refer a new brand to us

**Earnings Example:**
- Your client refers a brand that signs a $40,000 annual contract
- **You earn: $2,800 in service credits** (7% of $40k)
- Use credits for your own services or trade with other AMs

**Target:** 2-3 referrals per AM = $2,000-4,000 in credits

---

### 3. Clutch Review Credit Program
**What:** $500 service credit per qualified Clutch review you collect

**Earnings Example:**
- You collect 3 Clutch reviews from happy clients
- **You earn: $1,500 in service credits**

**Target:** 3-5 reviews per AM = $1,500-2,500 in credits

---

## Your 2026 Earnings Roadmap

### Baseline Scenario (Meet Targets)
- **2 cross-sells** at avg $5k each = **$10,000 commission**
- **2 referrals** at avg $1,500 each = **$3,000 credits**
- **3 reviews** at $500 each = **$1,500 credits**
- **Total: $14,500**

### Conservative Scenario (Partial Success)
- **1 cross-sell** = **$2,000-3,000 commission**
- **1 referral** = **$1,000-2,000 credits**
- **2 reviews** = **$1,000 credits**
- **Total: $4,000-6,000**

### Top Performer Scenario (Exceed Targets)
- **3 cross-sells** at avg $5k each = **$15,000 commission**
- **4 referrals** at avg $2,000 each = **$8,000 credits**
- **5 reviews** at $500 each = **$2,500 credits**
- **Total: $25,500**

**Your goal: Baseline. Anything above is bonus.**

## Program 1: Cross-Sell Playbook

### Who Should You Target?

**Step 1: Review Your Client Portfolio**

Pull up your client list and categorize each client:

**Priority 1 Targets (Pitch First):**
- Single-service clients with budgets >$10k/month
- Clients who frequently ask about the other service
- Clients with pain points the other service solves
- Clients renewing in Q1 2026 (timing opportunity)

**Priority 2 Targets (Pitch Second):**
- Single-service clients with budgets $5-10k/month
- Stable, happy clients (good relationship foundation)
- Clients with growth initiatives underway

**Do NOT Target:**
- Clients with frozen budgets or cost-cutting mode
- Clients who previously tried and stopped the service
- Clients with strong in-house teams for that function

**Excluded Clients List (check past-service-history.md):**
- United Scope (has in-house dev)
- Pair of Thieves (budgets frozen)
- Tori Richard (stopped marketing previously)
- Wyze (stopped marketing previously)
- Stikwood (paused dev retainer previously)

---

### How to Identify Cross-Sell Opportunities

**For Marketing Clients → Pitch Development When:**
- They mention site bugs or performance issues
- They want to launch new features but "dev is slow"
- They have aggressive growth goals requiring site improvements
- They're paying high hourly rates for ad-hoc dev work
- They're frustrated with their current development agency/freelancer

**Red Flags (Don't Pitch Dev):**
- They have a strong in-house dev team
- They recently hired a full-time developer
- They're happy with current dev agency
- Site is on a platform we don't specialize in (not Shopify/BigCommerce)

**For Development Clients → Pitch Marketing When:**
- They mention flat or declining revenue despite site improvements
- They ask "why isn't traffic converting better?"
- They have no email marketing strategy
- They're spending on ads with no tracking/optimization
- They have a great site but low traffic

**Red Flags (Don't Pitch Marketing):**
- They have a strong in-house marketing team
- They recently hired a CMO or marketing director
- They're happy with current marketing agency
- They have limited marketing budget (<$5k/month available)

---

### Cross-Sell Conversation Scripts

#### Opening the Conversation (Soft Approach)

**For Marketing → Development:**
> "Hey [Client], I've been thinking about your Q1 goals, especially around [specific growth target]. One thing I've noticed is [specific site issue/opportunity]. Our development team has helped several brands like yours solve this exact challenge — would you be open to a 15-minute conversation about how dev could accelerate your marketing results?"

**For Development → Marketing:**
> "Hey [Client], your site is performing really well on the technical side. I'm curious — what's your current strategy for driving traffic and converting visitors? Our marketing team specializes in Shopify/BigCommerce brands and has been crushing it for clients like [similar client]. Would you be open to a quick intro call to explore if there's an opportunity?"

#### During QBR (Natural Opportunity)

**For Marketing → Development:**
> "Looking at your marketing performance, your ads are driving great traffic, but I noticed [specific conversion issue]. This is often a site experience problem, not a marketing problem. Want me to have our dev team do a free conversion audit? No obligation — just helpful insights."

**For Development → Marketing:**
> "Your site is technically solid, but I'm curious about your marketing engine. Are you doing email marketing? Paid social? We've seen brands with sites like yours add $50-100k/month in revenue with the right marketing strategy. Want to explore what that could look like for you?"

#### After They Express Interest

> "Great! Let me set up a 30-minute intro call with [Dev Lead/Marketing Lead] to explore this. They'll come prepared with some ideas specific to your brand. I'll stay on the call too so we're all aligned. Does [day/time] work?"

---

### Time Investment Required

**Per Cross-Sell Attempt:**
- **Target identification:** 30 minutes (one-time, during portfolio review)
- **Prep conversation:** 15 minutes (understand their pain points)
- **Initial pitch:** 10 minutes (during existing QBR or check-in call)
- **Intro call:** 30 minutes (you + service lead + client)
- **Follow-up:** 15 minutes (answer questions, nudge decision)

**Total Time Per Attempt:** ~2 hours

**Expected Close Rate:** 30-40% of clients you pitch

**To Hit Target of 2 Cross-Sells:**
- Pitch 5-6 clients
- Time investment: ~10-12 hours over 6 months
- Commission earned: $4,000-6,000
- **Hourly value of your time: $350-500/hour**

**Worth it? Absolutely.**

---

### What Happens After You Make the Introduction?

1. **You facilitate intro call** (30 min) with you, client, and service lead
2. **Service lead takes ownership** of scoping and proposal
3. **You stay informed** via Slack updates and proposal reviews
4. **You help close** by reinforcing value during client check-ins
5. **Service lead closes** the contract
6. **You get paid commission** within 30 days of contract signature

**Your role: Identify opportunity, make warm introduction, support the close.**

**Not your role: Scope the project, write the proposal, price the engagement.**

---

## Program 2: Referral Playbook

### Who Should You Ask for Referrals?

**Priority 1 (Ask First):**
- Clients who have been with DYODE 1+ years
- Clients who frequently praise your work
- Clients in industries where brands talk to each other (apparel, beauty, CPG)
- Clients who are well-networked (attend conferences, active on LinkedIn)

**Priority 2 (Ask Second):**
- Clients with 6-12 months tenure who are happy
- Clients who recently had a major success/win with your team
- Clients who are part of brand communities or mastermind groups

**Do NOT Ask:**
- Brand new clients (<3 months)
- Clients with performance concerns or rocky relationships
- Clients in cost-cutting mode or struggling financially

---

### When to Ask for Referrals

**Best Timing:**
- **After a major win:** Campaign success, site launch, record revenue month
- **During QBR when results are strong:** Positive momentum in the relationship
- **After renewal:** They just committed to another term (high satisfaction signal)
- **When they proactively praise your work:** Strike while enthusiasm is hot

**Example Opening:**
> "I'm so glad to hear you're happy with [specific result]. Quick question — do you know any other brands in your network who might be looking for a Shopify development/marketing agency? We're taking on select new clients in 2026, and referrals from happy clients like you are always our best partnerships."

---

### Referral Credit Structure

| First Contract Value | Credit % | Example Commission |
|----------------------|----------|-------------------|
| $15,000 - $30,000 | 5% | $20k contract = **$1,000 credit** |
| $30,000 - $50,000 | 7% | $40k contract = **$2,800 credit** |
| $50,000 - $75,000 | 8% | $60k contract = **$4,800 credit** |
| $75,000+ | 10% | $90k contract = **$9,000 credit** |

**Credit Mechanics:**
- Credits applied to your future invoices (or traded with other AMs for personal use)
- 24-month expiration (plenty of time to use them)
- If referred client churns within 60 days, credit is clawed back

**Average Referral Value:** $30-50k contract = **$2,000-3,500 credits**

---

### Referral Conversation Scripts

#### During QBR (Natural Opening)

> "By the way, we've launched a new client referral program. If you know any brands in your network looking for a Shopify dev/marketing agency, we're offering a [credit amount] service credit for successful referrals. Do you have any connections who might be a good fit?"

#### After a Big Win

> "Congrats on [specific win]! This is exactly the kind of result we love delivering. Quick question — do you know any other brand founders or eCommerce leaders who could benefit from similar results? We're offering generous referral credits, and I'd love to help your network the way we've helped you."

#### Via Email (After Successful Project/Campaign)

**Subject:** Know anyone looking for a Shopify/eCommerce agency?

> Hi [Client],
>
> Hope you're doing well! I wanted to reach out because we've launched a referral program for clients like you.
>
> If you know any eCommerce brands (especially Shopify/BigCommerce) looking for development or marketing help, we're offering **[specific credit amount]** in service credits for successful referrals.
>
> We're being selective about new clients in 2026, but referrals from happy clients like you are always our best partnerships.
>
> Anyone come to mind? No pressure at all — just wanted to make you aware!
>
> Best,
> [Your Name]

---

### What Happens After a Referral?

1. **Client introduces you** to their contact (warm intro via email)
2. **You pass lead to sales team** with context about the referral source
3. **Sales team qualifies and closes** the opportunity
4. **You get credited** when the contract is signed
5. **Credits hit your account** within 30 days

**Your role: Ask for referrals, facilitate warm introduction, pass to sales.**

**Not your role: Qualify the lead, pitch services, close the deal.**

---

## Program 3: Clutch Review Playbook

### Who Should You Ask for Reviews?

**Priority 1 (Ask First):**
- Clients who recently had major successes with your team
- Long-term clients (1+ years) with consistently positive relationships
- Clients who have verbally praised your work multiple times
- Clients who recently renewed contracts (high satisfaction signal)

**Priority 2 (Ask Second):**
- Stable clients (6-12 months) with solid performance
- Clients in industries that value social proof (competitive verticals)
- Clients you helped through a major challenge or crisis

**Do NOT Ask:**
- Clients with active performance issues
- Brand new clients (<3 months)
- Clients who are lukewarm or neutral (they'll write lukewarm reviews)

---

### When to Ask for Reviews

**Best Timing:**
- **After a successful project delivery:** Site launch, major feature release
- **After record-breaking performance:** Best month ever, campaign success
- **During renewal conversation:** Positive momentum, they're committing again
- **After solving a major problem:** You rescued them from a crisis

**Example Opening:**
> "I'm so glad [project/campaign] was a success! We'd love to capture this experience in a Clutch review. It takes about 5 minutes, and we're offering a $500 service credit as a thank you. Would you be open to writing a quick review about your experience working with us?"

---

### Clutch Review Ask Scripts

#### During or After a Win

> "Hey [Client], congrats again on [specific success]! Quick request — would you be willing to write a Clutch review about your experience working with DYODE? It's a 5-minute survey, and we're offering a $500 service credit as a thank you. Clutch reviews are huge for us in attracting the right clients. Interested?"

#### Via Email (After Successful Project)

**Subject:** Quick favor? Write a Clutch review (5 min + $500 credit)

> Hi [Client],
>
> I hope you're thrilled with [project outcome/result] — I know our team loved working on it!
>
> I have a quick favor to ask: Would you be willing to write a Clutch review about your experience working with DYODE?
>
> **What's Clutch?** It's the leading platform where eCommerce brands research agencies. Reviews from clients like you help us attract the right partnerships.
>
> **What's in it for you?** We're offering a **$500 service credit** as a thank you (applied to your next invoice).
>
> **Time required:** About 5 minutes to complete their survey.
>
> Interested? I can send you the link right away!
>
> Best,
> [Your Name]

---

### What Happens After They Agree?

1. **You send them the Clutch review link** (you'll get this from marketing team)
2. **Clutch emails them** a survey to complete (5-10 minutes)
3. **They submit review** and Clutch verifies it
4. **Marketing team confirms** review is published
5. **You get $500 credit** applied to your account within 30 days

**Your role: Ask for review, send link, follow up if they forget.**

**Not your role: Write the review for them, pressure them, negotiate credit amount.**

## FAQs for Account Managers

### About Cross-Sell Commissions

**Q: When do I get paid my commission?**
A: Within 30 days of the contract being signed. If the client signs on Feb 15, you'll get paid by Mar 15.

**Q: What if the client signs a 3-month contract, then renews for 6 months? Do I get commission on the renewal?**
A: No, commission is only on the first contract you facilitated. Renewals are owned by the account manager managing that service line.

**Q: What if I pitch a cross-sell but the service lead closes it?**
A: You still get full commission as long as you made the introduction and the client acknowledges you brought them the opportunity.

**Q: Can I split commission with another AM if we both worked on it?**
A: Yes, if both AMs contributed meaningfully, you can split the commission 50/50. Discuss with co-founders if there's a dispute.

**Q: What if the client signs a smaller retainer than I expected?**
A: You get 5% of whatever they sign. If it's a $3k/month x 3-month contract ($9,000 total), your commission is $450.

**Q: Is there a cap on how many cross-sells I can earn commission on?**
A: Nope! If you cross-sell 5 clients, you earn commission on all 5.

---

### About Referral Credits

**Q: Can I use referral credits for personal services (like my own website or marketing)?**
A: Yes! Credits can be applied to any DYODE service, including personal projects.

**Q: Can I give my credits to another AM or trade them?**
A: Yes, credits are transferable within the team. If you don't need web dev but your colleague does, you can trade/gift credits.

**Q: What if the referred client signs but then cancels within 60 days?**
A: The credit is clawed back. We only reward referrals that turn into real, sustained clients.

**Q: Do credits expire?**
A: Yes, after 24 months. But that's plenty of time to use $2-4k in credits.

**Q: What if I refer someone but they don't sign until 6 months later?**
A: You still get the credit as long as you made the original introduction. We track all referrals in the CRM.

---

### About Review Credits

**Q: What qualifies as a "qualified" Clutch review?**
A: The client must complete the full Clutch survey (not just a couple sentences), verify their identity, and have the review published on our profile.

**Q: What if the client agrees but never submits the review?**
A: You don't get the credit until the review is published. Follow up gently after 1 week and 2 weeks if they haven't completed it.

**Q: Can I ask the same client for multiple reviews?**
A: No, one review per client. But you can collect reviews from multiple clients in your portfolio.

**Q: Do reviews expire?**
A: No, review credits never expire. Once earned, they're yours indefinitely.

---

### About Execution

**Q: How much time will this take?**
A: Realistically, 10-15 hours spread across the year:
- Cross-sells: ~10-12 hours total (2 hours per attempt x 5-6 attempts)
- Referrals: ~2-3 hours total (30 min per ask x 4-6 asks)
- Reviews: ~2-3 hours total (30 min per ask x 4-6 asks)

**Q: What if my clients don't have budget for cross-sells?**
A: That's fine! Focus on referrals and reviews instead. Not every AM will hit every target — play to your portfolio's strengths.

**Q: What if I'm uncomfortable asking for referrals or reviews?**
A: We'll practice scripting and role-play during training. Most AMs feel awkward at first, but it gets easier. Remember: happy clients WANT to help you — you just have to ask.

**Q: Do I have to participate in all three programs?**
A: No, but you should participate in at least two. If cross-sells don't fit your portfolio, focus on referrals and reviews.

**Q: What if I try to cross-sell and the client says no?**
A: That's totally fine! A "no" doesn't hurt your relationship if you ask respectfully. Move on to the next target.

## Final Thoughts

**This is your opportunity to earn significantly during a salary freeze.**

Here's the math again:
- **2 cross-sells** = $4,000-6,000
- **2 referrals** = $2,000-3,000
- **3 reviews** = $1,500

**Total: $7,500-10,500 in commissions/credits.**

That's more than most annual raises, and it's 100% in your control.

**What separates top performers from average performers?**

1. **They prepare:** Top AMs identify targets early and plan their timing
2. **They ask confidently:** They don't apologize for asking; they position it as value for the client
3. **They follow up:** They don't let referrals or reviews slip through the cracks
4. **They learn from "no":** They refine their pitch based on feedback and try again

**You have everything you need to succeed:**
- A strong portfolio of clients who trust you
- Clear targets and scripts
- Training and support from leadership
- Generous commission/credit structures

**Now it's up to you to execute.**

Let's make 2026 the year you prove your value as a revenue driver — and get paid for it.
