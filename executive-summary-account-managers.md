# 2026 Growth Strategy: Guide for Client-Facing Teams

**For:** Project Managers, Marketing Team, Sales
**From:** Tim Katz & George, Co-Founders
**Date:** December 2025
**Purpose:** Your role in driving sustainable growth and unlocking raises for everyone

---

## What This Means for You

You've been through 18 months of turbulence:
- 12 layoffs across the team
- Raises given in October 2024, then frozen in 2025
- Revenue declining from $4.86M → $3.4M
- Profit margins collapsing to 0.3% (essentially breakeven)

**You deserve stability.** And you've proven you can execute - the team avoided a forecasted $200k loss in 2025 and brought us back to breakeven.

**The 2026 plan is simple:**

✅ **Company-wide focus** - Everyone benefits when we succeed (no individual commission programs)

✅ **Short-term recognition** - Year-end bonuses (January 2027) based on 2026 performance

✅ **Long-term stability** - Raises unlock when we hit 12%+ margin for 3 consecutive quarters

✅ **Transparency** - Monthly updates showing exactly where we stand

## Your Role in 2026 Growth

Cross-selling, generating referrals, and collecting reviews are **expected job responsibilities** - not individually incentivized, but critical to everyone's success.

### What's Expected (By Role)

**Project Managers (Development Side):**
- Identify 2-3 cross-sell opportunities in 2026
- Generate 1-2 client referrals
- Collect 1-2 Clutch reviews after successful projects
- Maintain strong client relationships and retention

**Marketing Team (Director + Manager):**
- Identify 3-4 cross-sell opportunities in 2026
- Generate 2-3 client referrals
- Collect 2-3 Clutch reviews after successful campaigns
- Maintain strong client relationships and retention

**Director of Operations:**
- Close Martal SQLs and referrals at 30-40% rate
- Build proposals with healthy margins
- Control operational expenses
- Support cross-sell and referral pipeline

**Why These Matter:**
- **Cross-sells** → Higher retention (multi-service clients stay 50-70% longer) → Lower churn → Better margins
- **Referrals** → Lower acquisition cost → Better margins
- **Reviews** → Inbound leads → Lower acquisition cost → Better margins
- **Better margins** → Unlocks raises for everyone

## How You Get Rewarded

### Short-Term: Year-End Bonuses (January 2027)

Based on 2026 full-year average profit margin:

| 2026 Average Margin | Bonus Per Person | What This Means |
|---------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 0-3% (no improvement) | $0 | We didn't improve from 2025 |
| 4-6% (modest) | $400 | Solid progress |
| 7-9% (significant) | $750 | Strong execution |
| 10-11% (close to goal) | $1,250 | Almost there |
| 12%+ (goal achieved!) | $2,000 | Mission accomplished |

**Key Points:**
- Paid AFTER full 2026 results are in (no risk of premature payment like Oct 2024)
- Rewards progress, not just perfection
- Everyone gets the same amount (unity, not division)

### Long-Term: Raises Unlock

**Criteria:**
- 3 consecutive quarters at 12%+ margin (not 2 - learned from 2024-2025 volatility)
- OR full-year 2026 average of 12%+

**Raise Structure:**
- 3-5% merit-based raises
- Performance-differentiated (top performers get 5%, solid performers get 3%)
- Everyone eligible

**Estimated Timeline:**
- Best case: January 2027 (if Q2+Q3+Q4 2026 all hit 12%+)
- Standard case: Q2 2027 (if Q3+Q4 2026 + Q1 2027 hit 12%+)

## Your 2026 Playbook

### Cross-Selling: How to Identify Opportunities

**Look for these signals:**
- Client mentions pain point your other service solves
- Client is scaling and needs additional capabilities
- Client expresses satisfaction with current service
- Contract renewal conversation (natural expansion moment)

**Examples:**
- Development client mentions email marketing challenges → Pitch marketing services
- Marketing client mentions website performance issues → Pitch development services
- Consulting client ready to execute strategy → Pitch dev or marketing implementation

**How to Pitch:**
1. Identify the pain point
2. Connect it to business impact ("This could cost you X in lost revenue")
3. Position DYODE's other service as solution
4. Hand off to Director of Operations for proposal

**Important:** You're not expected to close the deal - just identify the opportunity and make the warm introduction.

### Generating Referrals: When and How to Ask

**Best Times to Ask:**
- After successful project completion
- During QBRs when client expresses satisfaction
- When client achieves milestone (successful campaign, site launch, revenue goal)

**How to Ask:**
- "I'm glad we've been able to help. Do you know any other brands facing similar challenges?"
- "We're looking to work with more brands like yours. Who in your network might benefit from our services?"
- "Would you be open to introducing us to [specific person/company]?"

**What Happens Next:**
- You pass referral to Director of Operations
- Director of Operations nurtures and closes
- Company benefits from lower acquisition cost → Better margins

### Collecting Clutch Reviews: Simple Ask

**When to Ask:**
- Within 2 weeks after successful project completion
- After positive feedback in QBR or Slack
- When client hits milestone using your work

**How to Ask:**
- "We'd love to feature your success story. Would you be willing to write a brief Clutch review?"
- Offer to make it easy: "I can send you a draft based on our conversations if that helps"
- Typical time commitment: 5-10 minutes for client

**Why This Matters:**
- Clutch reviews drive inbound leads
- Inbound leads have higher close rates and lower acquisition cost
- Better margins = unlocks raises

## Monthly Transparency: What You'll See

### Monthly Town Hall (10 Minutes)

**Profit Margin Update:**
- "This month: X% margin"
- "This quarter YTD: X% average"
- "2026 YTD average: X%"
- "On track for: $X-X bonus range in January 2027"

**Progress Toward Raises:**
- "We need 3 consecutive quarters at 12%+"
- "Current streak: X quarters at 12%+ (need 3 total)"

**Client & Revenue Update:**
- "Added X clients, lost X clients"
- "Current MRR: $XXXk"
- "Current active clients: X"

**Growth Activities:**
- "Cross-sells closed: X (target: 6-8 for year)"
- "Referrals converted: X (target: 5-8 for year)"
- "Clutch reviews: X (target: 10-15 for year)"

**Recognition:**
- Public shoutouts for cross-sells, referrals, reviews, excellent delivery

## Why This Approach?

### We Learned from 2024-2025 Mistakes

**What happened:**
- October 2024: Hit margin target for 2 consecutive quarters → Gave raises
- 2025: Margins were 1.3% → 5.5% → 8.5% → 0.1% (collapsed in Q4)
- Had to freeze raises again
- Team experienced whiplash

**What we're doing differently:**
- **3 consecutive quarters** (not 2) - proves true sustainability
- **Year-end bonuses** - gives team SOMETHING within 14 months (not endless waiting)
- **Graduated structure** - rewards progress even if we hit 8% avg (not all-or-nothing)
- **Transparency** - no surprises, everyone sees where we stand monthly

### Unity Over Division

After 12 layoffs, the team needs to rally together, not compete with each other.

**Company-wide approach means:**
- Everyone benefits when company succeeds
- No haves vs. have-nots
- Collaboration, not competition
- Simple, not complex administrative burden

## Your Questions Answered

**Q: Why not individual commissions for cross-sells and referrals?**

A: After 12 layoffs, we need unity, not division. Individual commissions create haves vs. have-nots. Everyone contributes to company success in different ways - some through client delivery, some through cross-sells, some through operational efficiency. When company succeeds, everyone benefits together.

**Q: What if I can't generate cross-sells or referrals?**

A: These are expected job responsibilities, like responding to emails promptly or delivering projects on time. If you're maintaining strong client relationships, opportunities will naturally arise. Directors will coach you on identifying and positioning opportunities.

**Q: How do I know if we're on track?**

A: Monthly town halls will show exactly where we stand. You'll see profit margin progress, cross-sell/referral/review counts, and what bonus range we're tracking toward. Full transparency, no surprises.

**Q: What if we don't hit 12% margin in 2026?**

A: Even if we hit 8% average, you get a $750 bonus (appreciation for improvement). And we keep executing in 2027 until we prove 3 consecutive quarters at 12%+ to unlock raises. This is a marathon, not a sprint.

**Q: Why 3 consecutive quarters instead of 2?**

A: In 2024, we hit target for 2 quarters, gave raises, then margins collapsed in 2025. 2 quarters proved we can spike, but not sustain. 3 quarters proves true stability and prevents repeating the whiplash.
