# Shopify Plus Premier Partner Status - 2026 Requirements & Tracking

**Last Updated:** November 11, 2025
**Status:** ⚠️ **AT RISK** - Urgent action required on 2 of 3 criteria

---

## Executive Summary

DYODE must meet **ALL THREE** criteria to maintain Shopify Plus Premier Partner tier in 2026. Losing Premier status would impact 61% of our MRR ($178k/month from Shopify/Plus clients) and eliminate competitive advantages for 2027+.

**Current Assessment:**
- ✅ **Criterion 1: Merchant Revenue** - Exceeds requirement (no action needed)
- ⚠️ **Criterion 2: Plus Referrals** - PRIMARY RISK (only 1 of 4 needed)
- ✅ **Criterion 3: Team Certifications** - ACHIEVABLE (12 of 30 completed, 16 in-progress)

## Complete Shopify Partner Tier Structure

| Tier | Merchant Revenue | Plus Referrals (2yr rolling) | People/Skills | Benefits |
|------|------------------|------------------------------|---------------|----------|
| **Select** | $100k-$500k | 1 Plus or 10 Standard (5yr) | 1 person / 3 certifications | Basic partner badge |
| **Plus** | $500k-$2.5M | 2 Plus or 40 Standard (5yr) | 3 people / 10 certifications | Enhanced support |
| **Premier** | $2M-$10M | **4 Plus or 40 Standard (2yr)** | 10 people / **30 certifications** | Priority support, co-marketing |
| **Platinum** | $5M-$25M | **6 Plus (2yr)** | 25 people / 80 certifications | Dedicated partner manager, top-tier |

**DYODE 2026 Target:** Premier Tier (Platinum not feasible due to team size constraints)

---

## Criterion 1: Merchant Revenue ✅ **EXCEEDS**

**Requirement:** Premier = $2M-$10M total GMV from merchants DYODE refers to Shopify

**Current Status:**
- DYODE has 15-20 Shopify Plus clients
- Estimated client GMV: $10M-$75M per merchant
- **Total estimated merchant revenue: $200M-$1B+**

**Assessment:** ✅ **Exceeds both Premier and Platinum thresholds**
**Action Required:** None - criterion already met

---

## Criterion 2: Plus Referrals (Migrations) ⚠️ **PRIMARY CONSTRAINT**

**Requirement:** Premier = 4 Shopify Plus referrals (2-year rolling window)

**What Counts as "Referral":**
- ✅ **COUNTS:** Platform migrations TO Shopify Plus from:
  - BigCommerce → Shopify Plus
  - Magento/Adobe Commerce → Shopify Plus
  - WooCommerce → Shopify Plus
  - Custom platforms → Shopify Plus
- ❌ **DOES NOT COUNT:**
  - Existing Shopify/Plus merchants (redesigns, retainers, ongoing work)
  - Shopify → Shopify Plus upgrades (confirm with Shopify)

**Current Status (2024-2025):**
- 2024: 0 Plus migrations ❌
- 2025: 0 Plus migrations ❌
- **Total 2-year: Only 1** (BuildDirect in 2023, rolling off soon)

**Historical Performance:**
- 2020: 2 migrations (Pali Wine, Brandless)
- 2021: 3 migrations (Invisalign, Steals, Belly Bandit)
- 2023: 1 migration (BuildDirect)
- 2024-2025: 0 migrations ❌❌

**Gap Analysis:**
- Need for Premier: 4 migrations in 2026
- Current pipeline: 2 opportunities (Jerome's, Bolle)
- **Required increase: 4x from recent 2-year performance**

**Assessment:** ⚠️ **URGENT PRIORITY - This is the PRIMARY RISK**

### 2026 Migration Targets & Strategy

**Quarterly Targets:**

| Quarter | Target | Cumulative | Milestone | Project Revenue | Critical Actions |
|---------|--------|------------|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Q1 2026** | 1 migration | 1 | Foundation | $75k | Re-engage Jerome's, close Martal SQLs |
| **Q2 2026** | 2 migrations | 3 | 75% to goal | $150k | Close Bolle (4 brands), Martal SQLs |
| **Q3 2026** | 1 migration | 4 | 🎯 **Premier Achieved** | $75k | Final push to 4 |
| **Q4 2026** | 0-2 migrations | 4-6 | Stretch to Platinum | $0-150k | Buffer quarter |
| **TOTAL** | **4-6 migrations** | **4-6** | **Premier/Platinum** | **$300-450k** | **Annual review** |

**Current Pipeline:**

| Opportunity | Platform | Est. Value | Timeline | Status | Confidence | Next Steps |
|-------------|----------|------------|----------|--------|------------|------------|
| **Jerome's Furniture** | Migration to Plus | ~$75k | Q1 2026 | On hold (tariffs) | 🟡 Medium | Week 1: Re-engage, assess timeline |
| **Bolle Brands** | Migration to Plus (4 brands) | ~$100-150k | Q2 2026 | Low communication | 🟡 Medium | Week 1: Schedule check-in call |

**Pipeline Gap:**
- Current: 2 opportunities
- Target: Need 4-6 migrations total
- **Gap: 2-4 additional opportunities needed**

**Sources to Fill Gap:**

| Source | Opps Needed | Close Rate | Expected Closes | Revenue Contribution |
|--------|-------------|------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Current pipeline | 2 (Jerome's, Bolle) | 50% | 1 | $75-125k |
| **Martal migration SQLs** | 10-12 | 35% | 3-4 | $225-300k |
| Founder outreach | 3-4 | 30% | 1 | $75k |
| Shopify referrals | 2-3 | 25% | 0-1 | $0-75k |
| **TOTAL** | **17-21 opps** | **~35% avg** | **5-7 closes** | **$375-575k** |

**Platform Targeting Priority:**
1. **BigCommerce** → Shopify Plus (easiest conversion, common pain points)
2. **Magento/Adobe Commerce** → Shopify Plus (strong ROI case, high costs)
3. **WooCommerce** → Shopify Plus (performance issues at scale)
4. **Custom/Legacy** → Shopify Plus (modernization, tech debt)

**Critical Success Factors:**
- ✅ Martal delivers 10-12 **migration-specific** SQLs (not just general Shopify Plus)
- ✅ Close rate of 35%+ on migration opportunities
- ✅ Re-engage Jerome's and Bolle in Q1 (before pipeline dries up)
- ✅ Founder dedicates time to high-value migration opportunities

**Current Status:**

### Staff Count: ✅ **MEETS REQUIREMENT**

- Premier requirement: 10 people
- Platinum requirement: 25 people
- **Status: ✅ Meets Premier, does not meet Platinum**

### Shopify Certifications: ⚠️ **IN PROGRESS**

- ⚠️ **In-Progress: 16 certifications** (assigned but not completed)
- 📊 **Potential: 28 certifications** (if all in-progress completed)

## Critical Insights

**Both Requirements Must Be Met:**
Even if DYODE closes 4 Plus migrations, we can still lose Premier tier if we don't reach 30 certifications by June 30, 2026. **Both requirements are mandatory.**

**Why This Matters:**
- 61% of MRR ($178k/month) comes from Shopify/Plus clients
- Partner badge = credibility, inbound leads, competitive advantage
- Access to Shopify partner referrals and co-marketing
- Priority support from Shopify
- **Without Premier+ status:** Lose competitive edge and inbound flow in 2027+

**Realistic Assessment:**
- ✅ **Certifications:** Highly achievable (already 40% complete, team has courses assigned)
- ⚠️ **Migrations:** Challenging but achievable (requires 4x increase from recent performance)
- ❌ **Platinum tier:** Not feasible in 2026 (would need 6 migrations + 25+ staff + 80 certifications)

**Focus:** Target Premier tier (4 migrations, 30 certifications) in 2026, build foundation for Platinum in 2027-2028.
