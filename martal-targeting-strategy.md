# Martal Lead Gen Targeting Strategy & Messaging

**Created:** November 2025
**Purpose:** Define ideal client profile, targeting criteria, and messaging for Martal lead generation partnership

**Context:** Martal partnership launched 11/1/25 with 3-month pilot (Nov 2025 - Jan 2026), 18 guaranteed SQLs

---

## Executive Summary

**Partnership Goals:**
- **Q1 2026 Target:** 3-6 closed clients from Martal SQLs
- **MRR Target:** $22,500 - $45,000 from Martal-sourced clients
- **Strategic Priority:** Focus on Shopify Plus opportunities to maintain partner status
- **Conversion Timeline:** 30-60 day sales cycle, expect lag between SQL delivery and closes

**Key Success Factors:**
1. Tight ICP targeting (Shopify Plus brands, $10M+ revenue)
2. Clear, results-focused messaging
3. Pain point-driven outreach (not feature-driven)
4. Founder involvement in high-value opportunities
5. Quality over quantity (18 well-qualified SQLs > 50 mediocre leads)

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Shopify Plus Partner Status - Migration Requirements

**URGENT CONTEXT:** DYODE must close **4-6 platform migrations TO Shopify Plus in 2026** to maintain Premium/Platinum partner status.

### What Counts for Partner Status

**✅ COUNTS TOWARD PARTNER STATUS:**
- Platform migrations **TO Shopify Plus** from:
  - BigCommerce → Shopify Plus
  - Magento → Shopify Plus
  - WooCommerce → Shopify Plus
  - Custom platforms → Shopify Plus
  - Adobe Commerce → Shopify Plus
  - SAP Commerce → Shopify Plus

**❌ DOES NOT COUNT:**
- Existing Shopify/Plus merchants (redesigns, retainers, ongoing work)
- Shopify → Shopify Plus upgrades
- Shopify Plus theme redesigns
- Feature development for current Plus merchants

### Historical Performance - Why This is Urgent

**Migration History:**
- 2020: 2 migrations (Pali Wine, Brandless)
- 2021: 3 migrations (Invisalign, Steals, Belly Bandit)
- 2023: 1 migration (BuildDirect)
- 2024: 0 migrations ❌
- 2025: 0 migrations ❌

**⚠️ Reality Check:** Need to close **4-6 migrations in 2026** = **4-6x increase** from recent 2-year performance

### 2026 Migration Targets from Martal

**Pilot Phase (Nov 2025 - Jan 2026):**
- **Total SQLs guaranteed:** 18
- **Migration SQLs required:** 3-4 (highest priority)
- **Expected migration closes from pilot:** 1-2 in Q1 2026

**Full Year 2026 from Martal:**
- **Migration SQLs needed:** 10-12 total
- **Expected migration closes:** 4-6 (at 30-35% close rate)

**Quarterly Deadlines:**
- Q1 2026: 1-2 migrations closed (by March 31)
- Q2 2026: 1-2 migrations closed (by June 30)
- Q3 2026: 1 migration closed (by Sept 30)
- Q4 2026: 0-1 migration closed (by Dec 31)

### Migration SQL = 2-3x Value of Regular SQL

**Why Migration SQLs Are Priority:**
1. Partner status preservation (critical for 2027+ inbound leads)
2. Larger project values ($50k-$300k, avg ~$75k)
3. Often convert to ongoing retainers post-migration
4. Higher strategic value than standalone retainer sales

**Martal Priority Structure:**
- **Tier 1 (Highest Priority):** Migration SQL from target platform (BigCommerce, Magento, WooCommerce)
- **Tier 2 (High Priority):** Shopify Plus SQL for $10k+/month retainer
- **Tier 3 (Good):** Shopify Plus SQL for $7-10k/month retainer

---

## Ideal Client Profile (ICP)

### Primary Target: Shopify Plus Development Clients

**Why Shopify Plus is Priority #1:**
- DYODE needs 4-6 Shopify Plus projects in 2026 to maintain Premium/Platinum partner status
- Shopify Plus represents 61% of current MRR
- Partner status drives inbound leads and credibility
- Competitive advantage in sales process

**Company Characteristics:**

| Criteria | Ideal | Acceptable | Avoid |
|----------|-------|------------|-------|
| **Platform (Tier 1 - Migration Priority)** | BigCommerce, Magento, WooCommerce (Plus-qualified) | Custom platforms, Adobe Commerce | Shopify Basic/Standard (<$10M revenue) |
| **Platform (Tier 2 - Retainer Priority)** | Shopify Plus (existing) | Shopify (scaling to Plus, $10M+) | Other platforms not Plus-qualified |
| **Annual Revenue** | $15M - $75M | $10M - $15M or $75M+ | <$10M |
| **eCommerce % of Revenue** | 80%+ | 50-80% | <50% (omnichannel) |
| **Current Tech Stack** | Shopify Plus, Klaviyo, Attentive, Yotpo | Shopify Plus + basic apps | Legacy/custom platforms |
| **Team Size** | 20-200 employees | 10-20 or 200-500 | <10 or 500+ |
| **In-house Dev Team** | 0-2 devs (need support) | 3-5 devs (need overflow) | 6+ devs (unlikely to outsource) |
| **Growth Stage** | Series A-C, profitable | Bootstrapped, high-growth | Pre-revenue, enterprise (>$500M) |

---

### Geographic Targeting

**Priority Markets:**

1. **United States** (Primary)
   - West Coast: CA (LA, SF, San Diego)
   - East Coast: NY, MA, FL
   - Central: TX (Austin, Dallas), CO (Denver)

2. **Canada** (Secondary)
   - Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal

**Why:** US/Canada brands are familiar with DYODE's service model, pricing, and timezone compatibility.

---

### Industry/Vertical Targeting

**High-Fit Verticals:**

| Vertical | Why Good Fit | Example Brands |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Apparel & Fashion** | Complex product catalog, seasonal, high SKU count | AG Jeans, Beach Riot, L*Space |
| **Beauty & Cosmetics** | Subscription models, high repeat purchase | SiO Beauty, Kindred Bravely |
| **Home & Lifestyle** | Custom features, B2C and B2B | Cookware Co, Stikwood |
| **Food & Beverage** | DTC subscriptions, compliance needs | (open to prospects) |
| **Sporting Goods** | High AOV, seasonal launches | (open to prospects) |
| **Consumer Electronics** | Complex products, warranty management | Wyze, Movano |

**Good-Fit Indicators:**
- Selling physical products (not just digital)
- High SKU counts (500+ products)
- Seasonal launch cycles
- Complex product configurations
- Subscription or membership models
- B2C with some B2B wholesale

**Avoid:**
- Drop-shipping businesses
- Marketplace aggregators
- Print-on-demand only
- Low-margin commodities
- Heavy custom development needs (better for agencies with larger dev teams)

---

### Technographic Targeting

#### For Migration Opportunities (Tier 1 Priority)

**Target Platforms (in priority order):**

1. **BigCommerce** (Highest Priority)
   - Why: Common pain points (scalability, checkout limitations, app ecosystem)
   - Typical revenue: $10M-$100M
   - Migration project value: $50k-$150k
   - Common migration triggers: Site performance issues, feature limitations, checkout problems

2. **Magento / Adobe Commerce**
   - Why: High maintenance costs, complexity, developer scarcity
   - Typical revenue: $20M-$200M
   - Migration project value: $100k-$300k
   - Common migration triggers: High hosting costs, difficult to maintain, slow to iterate

3. **WooCommerce**
   - Why: Outgrowing platform, scalability issues
   - Typical revenue: $5M-$30M
   - Migration project value: $40k-$100k
   - Common migration triggers: Performance at scale, security concerns, plugin conflicts

4. **Custom Platforms**
   - Why: Legacy tech debt, expensive to maintain
   - Typical revenue: $15M-$100M
   - Migration project value: $75k-$250k
   - Common migration triggers: Developer turnover, maintenance costs, can't move fast

**Migration Readiness Signals:**
- Platform on old version (not keeping up with updates)
- Frequent site performance complaints (Twitter, reviews)
- Job postings for "eCommerce Platform Manager" or "Migration PM"
- Recent funding round (capital to invest in replatforming)
- Mentions "tech debt" or "legacy platform" in content/interviews

#### For Retainer Opportunities (Tier 2 Priority)

**Must-Have:**
- Shopify Plus (or Shopify scaling to Plus)

**High-Value Signals:**
- **Email/SMS:** Klaviyo, Attentive, Postscript
- **Reviews:** Yotpo, Okendo, Stamped
- **Subscriptions:** Recharge, Skio, Stay AI
- **Loyalty:** Smile.io, Yotpo Loyalty
- **Search:** Algolia, Searchspring
- **Personalization:** Nosto, LimeSpot

**Red Flags:**
- Heavy custom headless build (may need specialized dev team)
- Recently migrated to Shopify (may not need dev for 6-12 months)
- Using 50+ apps (likely Frankenstein stack, hard to work with)

---

### Buyer Persona

**Primary Decision Maker:**

**Title:**
- VP of eCommerce / Head of eCommerce
- Director of Digital
- CMO (smaller brands)
- Founder/CEO (smaller brands <$20M revenue)

**Profile:**
- 3-7 years in eCommerce
- Responsible for site performance, conversion, revenue
- Likely juggling multiple priorities
- Has in-house marketing but limited/no dev resources
- Frustrated with slow agency response times or lack of technical depth

**Pain Points:**
- Site speed and performance issues impacting conversion
- Can't move fast enough on feature requests and site updates
- Stuck with a dev agency that doesn't understand eCommerce
- Spending too much time managing freelancers
- Need strategic partner, not just order-takers
- Want to scale without hiring full-time devs

**What They Care About:**
- Revenue impact (not just "we'll build features")
- Speed to market (agile, fast iteration)
- Shopify Plus expertise (not generalist agency)
- Strategic guidance, not just execution
- Transparent communication and proactive updates

---

## Messaging Framework

### Core Value Proposition

**Primary Message:**
"We help fast-growing Shopify Plus brands increase revenue through high-performing, conversion-optimized development — without the overhead of hiring a full-time team."

**Why This Works:**
- Leads with outcome (increase revenue), not service (we do dev)
- Specifies platform (Shopify Plus = premium)
- Implies ROI (conversion-optimized = we understand eCommerce)
- Addresses key objection (no need to hire in-house)

---

### Secondary Value Props (Choose 1-2 per outreach)

1. **Speed & Agility**
   - "Ship features 2-3x faster than traditional agencies"
   - "From brief to live in days, not weeks"

2. **Shopify Plus Expertise**
   - "Certified Shopify Plus partners with [X] Plus builds under our belt"
   - "Deep Shopify ecosystem knowledge — we know what works"

3. **eCommerce-First**
   - "We speak eCommerce, not just development"
   - "Every feature is built with conversion and revenue in mind"

4. **Strategic Partnership**
   - "Dev partner + strategic advisor, not just order-takers"
   - "Proactive recommendations to improve performance"

5. **Transparent & Reliable**
   - "No surprises: predictable pricing, clear timelines"
   - "Slack-based communication, weekly updates"

---

### Pain Point-Driven Messaging

**Instead of:** "We build Shopify Plus sites"
**Use:** "Tired of waiting weeks for simple site updates? We help [Brand Type] brands ship features 3x faster."

**Instead of:** "We offer development and marketing services"
**Use:** "Is slow site speed costing you conversions? We've helped [similar brand] improve load times by 40% and increase revenue by 18%."

**Instead of:** "We're a Shopify Plus agency"
**Use:** "Frustrated with a dev team that doesn't understand eCommerce? We've helped [X] Shopify Plus brands scale from $10M to $50M+ without hiring in-house."

**Key Principle:** Lead with pain/outcome, not features/services.

---

### Messaging Do's and Don'ts

**DO:**
- ✅ Lead with results and outcomes
- ✅ Use specific metrics ("increased conversion 18%", not "improved performance")
- ✅ Name-drop relevant clients (if permitted)
- ✅ Speak their language (revenue, AOV, conversion, CAC)
- ✅ Focus on speed and agility
- ✅ Position as strategic partner, not vendor

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Lead with "we do development"
- ❌ List all services (dev, marketing, consulting) — pick one focus
- ❌ Use technical jargon ("headless," "JAMstack," "API-first")
- ❌ Talk about "us" more than "you"
- ❌ Generic claims ("best agency," "award-winning")
- ❌ Discount/price-focused messaging (attracts wrong clients)

## Email Outreach Templates

### Template 1: Performance/Speed Angle

**Subject:** Quick question about [Brand]'s site speed

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

I was checking out [Brand]'s site and noticed [specific observation — e.g., "your product pages are loading in 4-5 seconds on mobile"].

For Shopify Plus brands doing [$XX]M+, slow site speed typically costs 10-15% in lost conversions.

We've helped brands like [Similar Brand] cut load times by 40% and increase mobile conversion by 12-18% through [specific approach].

Would it be worth a quick 15-minute call to explore what might be possible for [Brand]?

Best,
[Name]

---

### Template 2: Feature Velocity Angle

**Subject:** [Brand]'s Q1 roadmap

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

Most Shopify Plus brands we talk to have a long list of features they want to ship in Q1 but are bottlenecked by dev capacity.

If [Brand] is in a similar spot, we might be able to help. We work with [X] Shopify Plus brands as their outsourced dev team, helping them ship features 2-3x faster than traditional agencies.

Recent example: [Similar Brand] wanted to launch [feature] before Black Friday. We went from brief to live in 11 days.

Open to a quick 15-minute call to see if there's a fit?

Best,
[Name]

---

### Template 3: Strategic Partner Angle

**Subject:** [Brand]'s eCommerce dev strategy

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

Quick question: Is [Brand] working with a dev agency, managing freelancers, or considering hiring in-house?

We work with a lot of Shopify Plus brands in the [$XX-XX]M revenue range who've decided that hiring a full-time dev team is too expensive/slow, but freelancers are inconsistent.

We act as an outsourced dev team — combining the speed of an agency with the strategic thinking of an in-house team.

Brands like [Similar Brand] and [Similar Brand] use us as their primary dev partner. Happy to share how it works if it's relevant.

Worth a 15-minute call?

Best,
[Name]

---

### Template 4: Case Study / Social Proof Angle

**Subject:** How [Similar Brand] scaled from $15M to $40M

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

Saw that [Brand] is in a similar space to one of our clients, [Similar Brand].

When we started working with them in [Year], they were doing ~$15M and struggling with [specific pain point]. Fast forward to today, they're at $40M+ and we've been their dev partner the entire way.

Some things we helped with:
- [Specific outcome #1]
- [Specific outcome #2]
- [Specific outcome #3]

Not sure if [Brand] is facing similar challenges, but happy to share the full story if it's relevant.

Open to a quick call?

Best,
[Name]

---

### Template 5: Platform Migration Angle (BigCommerce)

**Subject:** Is BigCommerce holding [Brand] back?

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

I noticed [Brand] is on BigCommerce. We work with a lot of brands in the [$XX-XX]M range who've hit a wall with BC — checkout limitations, slow feature development, performance issues at scale.

We've helped brands like [Similar Brand] migrate from BigCommerce to Shopify Plus. Their checkout conversion improved by 22% and they can now ship features in days instead of months.

Not sure if [Brand] is experiencing similar frustrations, but if you're evaluating a migration or just curious what's possible on Shopify Plus, happy to share what we're seeing.

Worth a quick 15-minute call?

Best,
[Name]

---

### Template 6: Platform Migration Angle (Magento)

**Subject:** [Brand]'s Magento migration timeline

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

Quick question: Is [Brand] actively evaluating a move away from Magento, or are you committed to Adobe Commerce for the foreseeable future?

We're seeing a wave of Magento brands migrating to Shopify Plus to reduce maintenance costs and move faster. Recent example: [Similar Brand] was spending $40k+/month on Magento hosting and dev. Post-migration, they're at $12k/month total and shipping features 3x faster.

If you're in evaluation mode (or just frustrated with Magento's complexity), happy to share what a realistic migration looks like.

Worth a quick call?

Best,
[Name]

---

### Template 7: Platform Migration Angle (WooCommerce)

**Subject:** Has [Brand] outgrown WooCommerce?

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

Most WooCommerce brands we talk to in the [$XX]M+ range hit a point where performance and scalability become real problems. Site speed suffers, plugins conflict, and you're spending more time managing the tech than growing the business.

We've migrated [X] WooCommerce brands to Shopify Plus. Common results:
- 40-60% improvement in site speed
- 80% reduction in maintenance time
- Checkout conversion up 15-25%

Not sure if [Brand] is at that inflection point, but if you're curious what a migration looks like (timeline, cost, risk mitigation), happy to walk you through it.

Open to a quick call?

Best,
[Name]

---

### Template 8: Platform Migration Angle (Custom Platform)

**Subject:** [Brand]'s custom platform — asset or liability?

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

I saw that [Brand] is on a custom-built platform. In our experience, custom platforms start as an asset (perfect for your needs) but become a liability as developers turn over and tech debt piles up.

We've helped brands like [Similar Brand] migrate from custom platforms to Shopify Plus. They went from "it takes 6 weeks to add a feature" to "we shipped [feature] in 9 days."

Not sure if [Brand] is feeling that pain yet, but if your custom platform is slowing you down (or your dev team is underwater), happy to share what a modern commerce stack looks like.

Worth a 15-minute call?

Best,
[Name]

## Qualifying Questions (for SQLs)

Martal should qualify leads based on these questions BEFORE passing them as SQLs:

### Qualification Criteria

#### For Migration Opportunities (Tier 1 - Highest Priority)

**Must-Have (Disqualify if NO):**
1. ☑️ Currently on **non-Shopify platform** (BigCommerce, Magento, WooCommerce, custom)?
2. ☑️ Annual revenue **>$10M** (Shopify Plus qualified)?
3. ☑️ Ready to evaluate migration in **next 90 days**?
4. ☑️ Budget allocated or available for migration project in **Q1-Q2 2026**?
5. ☑️ Decision-maker or directly involved in platform evaluation?

**Strong Migration Signals (2+ = High-Quality SQL):**
- Experiencing platform performance issues (site speed, downtime)
- Frustrated with slow feature development or platform limitations
- High maintenance costs (hosting, developers, plugins)
- Developer turnover or difficulty finding platform-specific devs
- Recent funding round (capital for replatforming)
- Mentions "evaluating platforms" or "considering migration"
- Job postings for migration PM or platform manager
- Contract renewal coming up (switching costs already sunk)

**Migration SQL Handoff Requirements:**
- Current platform and version
- Primary pain points with current platform
- Migration timeline and urgency
- Budget range for migration project
- Post-migration retainer interest (convert to Tier 2 opportunity)

#### For Retainer Opportunities (Tier 2 - High Priority)

**Must-Have (Disqualify if NO):**
1. ☑️ Are you on Shopify Plus (or planning to migrate in next 6 months)?
2. ☑️ Annual revenue >$10M?

---

## Success Metrics & Iteration

### Tracking Performance

**Track Monthly:**

**Primary Metrics (Migration Focus):**
- **Migration SQLs delivered** (target: 1-1.5/month = 3-4 in pilot, 10-12 in 2026)
- **Migration opportunities created** (qualified migration projects in pipeline)
- **Migration deals closed** (target: 1-2 in Q1, 4-6 total in 2026)
- **Migration project value** (target: $75k avg, $300-450k total in 2026)

**Secondary Metrics (Retainer Focus):**
- Total SQLs delivered (target: 6/month, 18 in pilot)
- Retainer SQLs converted to qualified opportunities
- Retainer deals closed (target: 3-4 in Q1)
- MRR added from Martal-sourced retainer clients

**Combined Metrics:**
- Total revenue from Martal (migration projects + retainer MRR)
- Sales cycle length by type (migrations: 45-60 days, retainers: 30-45 days)
- SQL → Close conversion rate by type

**⚠️ CRITICAL SUCCESS INDICATOR:**
If migration SQL delivery is <1/month by end of Month 1, immediately adjust targeting strategy.

**Evaluate After Month 1 (December 2025):**
- **Migration SQL quality:** Are we getting true migration opportunities from target platforms?
- **Platform mix:** Are we seeing BigCommerce, Magento, WooCommerce SQLs? (vs. just existing Shopify Plus)
- **Migration messaging:** What angles are resonating? (pain points, cost savings, speed)
- **Retainer SQL quality:** How many are truly qualified for $8-12k/month retainer?
- **Response rates:** Which templates/angles are working best?

**Adjust Strategy if Needed:**
- **If migration SQLs <3 in Month 1:** Increase platform targeting, adjust messaging to focus on migration pain points
- **If migration SQL quality low:** Tighten qualification criteria, add platform-specific pain point questions
- **If retainer response rates low:** Test new messaging angles, adjust ICP
- **If conversion low:** Check if sales process, pricing, or timeline expectations are the issue

## Competitor Positioning

### How to Position Against Competitors

**vs. Other Shopify Plus Agencies:**
- **DYODE Advantage:** Speed, eCommerce-first focus, strategic partnership model
- **Message:** "Unlike traditional agencies that treat you like a ticket number, we act as an extension of your team"

**vs. Freelancers:**
- **DYODE Advantage:** Team depth, reliability, strategic guidance
- **Message:** "Freelancers are great for one-off projects, but if you need a reliable partner who can scale with you, you need a team"

**vs. In-House Hiring:**
- **DYODE Advantage:** Lower cost, faster ramp, no HR overhead
- **Message:** "Hiring a full-time Shopify Plus dev costs $120-150k/year + benefits + recruiting. With DYODE, you get an entire team for less."

**vs. Larger Agencies (Barrel, Haus, etc.):**
- **DYODE Advantage:** More personal, faster, less bureaucratic
- **Message:** "Large agencies come with account managers, layers of approval, and slow timelines. We're nimble and founder-led."

---

---

## Pricing Guidance for Martal

### What to Say About Pricing

**If Prospects Ask:**

"DYODE's retainer packages typically range from **$6,500 to $15,000 per month** depending on the scope, with most clients in the **$8-12k/month range**.

They offer flexible engagements — typically 6-month contracts to start, with the option to scale up or down based on your needs.

Happy to connect you with [DYODE Founder] to discuss specifics for your situation."

**DON'T:**
- Quote exact pricing (let DYODE handle custom pricing)
- Promise discounts or "special offers"

- Any verticals to avoid?

**Process Improvements:**
- Handoff working smoothly?

- Timeline expectations aligned?

---

## Red Flags (Poor-Fit Leads)

Martal should **disqualify** or **deprioritize** these leads:

❌ **Platform Red Flags:**
- **Shopify Basic/Standard with <$5M revenue** (too small, not Plus-qualified)
- **Recently migrated to Shopify Plus** (<6 months ago, unlikely to need dev yet)
- **NOTE:** BigCommerce, Magento, WooCommerce, Custom platforms are **TIER 1 TARGETS** for migration opportunities (not red flags!)

❌ **Revenue Red Flags:**
- <$5M annual revenue (too small, can't afford $8-12k/month retainer or $50k+ migration)
- >$200M revenue (likely have in-house team or work with large agency)

❌ **Budget Red Flags:**
- "We're looking for the cheapest option"
- No allocated budget for 2026
- Seeking one-time project only (not retainer)

❌ **Organizational Red Flags:**
- Can't identify decision-maker
- "We're just exploring options" (no urgency)
- Junior stakeholder without authority

❌ **Technical Red Flags:**
- Heavy custom headless build (beyond DYODE's core expertise)
- Need enterprise-level dev team (10+ devs)
- Looking for offshore/low-cost development

## Immediate Actions

### Week 1 (Late November 2025):

**DYODE:**
- [ ] Provide Martal with this targeting strategy document (with migration priority clarification)
- [ ] Share 2-3 approved case studies (with client permission)
- [ ] Align on SQL definition and qualification criteria (migration vs. retainer tiers)
- [ ] Set up monthly check-in cadence
- [ ] **Emphasize migration priority:** 3-4 migration SQLs in pilot (out of 18 total)

**Martal:**
- [ ] Review ICP and confirm understanding of **Tier 1 (Migration) vs Tier 2 (Retainer)** priorities
- [ ] Build target account lists:
  - **List A (Tier 1):** BigCommerce, Magento, WooCommerce brands $10M+ (migration targets)
  - **List B (Tier 2):** Shopify Plus brands $10M+ (retainer targets)
- [ ] Test migration messaging angles first (Templates 5-8) with Tier 1 list
- [ ] Test retainer messaging angles (Templates 1-4) with Tier 2 list
- [ ] Set up tracking for key metrics (separate migration vs retainer SQL counts)

**Critical First Month Goal:**
- **3-4 migration SQLs delivered** by end of December 2025
- **Adjust immediately** if not on track by mid-December

### Ongoing:

- **Weekly:** Martal shares SQL updates (who's engaged, objections, timeline) - **flag migration opportunities**
- **Bi-Weekly (First Month):** Quick check-in on migration SQL progress (course-correct early if needed)
- **Monthly:** Joint performance review and strategy adjustment
- **As Needed:** DYODE provides new case studies, messaging updates, ICP refinements
