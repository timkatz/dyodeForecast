# Martal Lead Gen Targeting Strategy & Messaging

**Created:** November 2025
**Purpose:** Define ideal client profile, targeting criteria, and messaging for Martal lead generation partnership

**Context:** Martal partnership launched 11/1/25 with 3-month pilot (Nov 2025 - Jan 2026), 18 guaranteed SQLs

---

## Executive Summary

**Partnership Goals:**
- **Q1 2026 Target:** 3-6 closed clients from Martal SQLs
- **MRR Target:** $22,500 - $45,000 from Martal-sourced clients
- **Strategic Priority:** Focus on Shopify Plus opportunities to maintain partner status
- **Conversion Timeline:** 30-60 day sales cycle, expect lag between SQL delivery and closes

**Key Success Factors:**
1. Tight ICP targeting (Shopify Plus brands, $10M+ revenue)
2. Clear, results-focused messaging
3. Pain point-driven outreach (not feature-driven)
4. Founder involvement in high-value opportunities
5. Quality over quantity (18 well-qualified SQLs > 50 mediocre leads)

---

## Ideal Client Profile (ICP)

### Primary Target: Shopify Plus Development Clients

**Why Shopify Plus is Priority #1:**
- DYODE needs 4-6 Shopify Plus projects in 2026 to maintain Premium/Platinum partner status
- Shopify Plus represents 61% of current MRR
- Partner status drives inbound leads and credibility
- Competitive advantage in sales process

**Company Characteristics:**

| Criteria | Ideal | Acceptable | Avoid |
|----------|-------|------------|-------|
| **Platform** | Shopify Plus | Shopify (scaling to Plus) | Other platforms |
| **Annual Revenue** | $15M - $75M | $10M - $15M or $75M+ | <$10M |
| **eCommerce % of Revenue** | 80%+ | 50-80% | <50% (omnichannel) |
| **Current Tech Stack** | Shopify Plus, Klaviyo, Attentive, Yotpo | Shopify Plus + basic apps | Legacy/custom platforms |
| **Team Size** | 20-200 employees | 10-20 or 200-500 | <10 or 500+ |
| **In-house Dev Team** | 0-2 devs (need support) | 3-5 devs (need overflow) | 6+ devs (unlikely to outsource) |
| **Growth Stage** | Series A-C, profitable | Bootstrapped, high-growth | Pre-revenue, enterprise (>$500M) |

---

### Geographic Targeting

**Priority Markets:**

1. **United States** (Primary)
   - West Coast: CA (LA, SF, San Diego)
   - East Coast: NY, MA, FL
   - Central: TX (Austin, Dallas), CO (Denver)

2. **Canada** (Secondary)
   - Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal

**Why:** US/Canada brands are familiar with DYODE's service model, pricing, and timezone compatibility.

---

### Industry/Vertical Targeting

**High-Fit Verticals:**

| Vertical | Why Good Fit | Example Brands |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| **Apparel & Fashion** | Complex product catalog, seasonal, high SKU count | AG Jeans, Beach Riot, L*Space |
| **Beauty & Cosmetics** | Subscription models, high repeat purchase | SiO Beauty, Kindred Bravely |
| **Home & Lifestyle** | Custom features, B2C and B2B | Cookware Co, Stikwood |
| **Food & Beverage** | DTC subscriptions, compliance needs | (open to prospects) |
| **Sporting Goods** | High AOV, seasonal launches | (open to prospects) |
| **Consumer Electronics** | Complex products, warranty management | Wyze, Movano |

**Good-Fit Indicators:**
- Selling physical products (not just digital)
- High SKU counts (500+ products)
- Seasonal launch cycles
- Complex product configurations
- Subscription or membership models
- B2C with some B2B wholesale

**Avoid:**
- Drop-shipping businesses
- Marketplace aggregators
- Print-on-demand only
- Low-margin commodities
- Heavy custom development needs (better for agencies with larger dev teams)

---

### Technographic Targeting

**Must-Have:**
- Shopify Plus (or Shopify scaling to Plus)

**High-Value Signals:**
- **Email/SMS:** Klaviyo, Attentive, Postscript
- **Reviews:** Yotpo, Okendo, Stamped
- **Subscriptions:** Recharge, Skio, Stay AI
- **Loyalty:** Smile.io, Yotpo Loyalty
- **Search:** Algolia, Searchspring
- **Personalization:** Nosto, LimeSpot

**Red Flags:**
- Heavy custom headless build (may need specialized dev team)
- Recently migrated to Shopify (may not need dev for 6-12 months)
- Using 50+ apps (likely Frankenstein stack, hard to work with)

---

### Buyer Persona

**Primary Decision Maker:**

**Title:**
- VP of eCommerce / Head of eCommerce
- Director of Digital
- CMO (smaller brands)
- Founder/CEO (smaller brands <$20M revenue)

**Profile:**
- 3-7 years in eCommerce
- Responsible for site performance, conversion, revenue
- Likely juggling multiple priorities
- Has in-house marketing but limited/no dev resources
- Frustrated with slow agency response times or lack of technical depth

**Pain Points:**
- Site speed and performance issues impacting conversion
- Can't move fast enough on feature requests and site updates
- Stuck with a dev agency that doesn't understand eCommerce
- Spending too much time managing freelancers
- Need strategic partner, not just order-takers
- Want to scale without hiring full-time devs

**What They Care About:**
- Revenue impact (not just "we'll build features")
- Speed to market (agile, fast iteration)
- Shopify Plus expertise (not generalist agency)
- Strategic guidance, not just execution
- Transparent communication and proactive updates

---

## Messaging Framework

### Core Value Proposition

**Primary Message:**
"We help fast-growing Shopify Plus brands increase revenue through high-performing, conversion-optimized development — without the overhead of hiring a full-time team."

**Why This Works:**
- Leads with outcome (increase revenue), not service (we do dev)
- Specifies platform (Shopify Plus = premium)
- Implies ROI (conversion-optimized = we understand eCommerce)
- Addresses key objection (no need to hire in-house)

---

### Secondary Value Props (Choose 1-2 per outreach)

1. **Speed & Agility**
   - "Ship features 2-3x faster than traditional agencies"
   - "From brief to live in days, not weeks"

2. **Shopify Plus Expertise**
   - "Certified Shopify Plus partners with [X] Plus builds under our belt"
   - "Deep Shopify ecosystem knowledge — we know what works"

3. **eCommerce-First**
   - "We speak eCommerce, not just development"
   - "Every feature is built with conversion and revenue in mind"

4. **Strategic Partnership**
   - "Dev partner + strategic advisor, not just order-takers"
   - "Proactive recommendations to improve performance"

5. **Transparent & Reliable**
   - "No surprises: predictable pricing, clear timelines"
   - "Slack-based communication, weekly updates"

---

### Pain Point-Driven Messaging

**Instead of:** "We build Shopify Plus sites"
**Use:** "Tired of waiting weeks for simple site updates? We help [Brand Type] brands ship features 3x faster."

**Instead of:** "We offer development and marketing services"
**Use:** "Is slow site speed costing you conversions? We've helped [similar brand] improve load times by 40% and increase revenue by 18%."

**Instead of:** "We're a Shopify Plus agency"
**Use:** "Frustrated with a dev team that doesn't understand eCommerce? We've helped [X] Shopify Plus brands scale from $10M to $50M+ without hiring in-house."

**Key Principle:** Lead with pain/outcome, not features/services.

---

### Messaging Do's and Don'ts

**DO:**
- ✅ Lead with results and outcomes
- ✅ Use specific metrics ("increased conversion 18%", not "improved performance")
- ✅ Name-drop relevant clients (if permitted)
- ✅ Speak their language (revenue, AOV, conversion, CAC)
- ✅ Focus on speed and agility
- ✅ Position as strategic partner, not vendor

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Lead with "we do development"
- ❌ List all services (dev, marketing, consulting) — pick one focus
- ❌ Use technical jargon ("headless," "JAMstack," "API-first")
- ❌ Talk about "us" more than "you"
- ❌ Generic claims ("best agency," "award-winning")
- ❌ Discount/price-focused messaging (attracts wrong clients)

## Email Outreach Templates

### Template 1: Performance/Speed Angle

**Subject:** Quick question about [Brand]'s site speed

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

I was checking out [Brand]'s site and noticed [specific observation — e.g., "your product pages are loading in 4-5 seconds on mobile"].

For Shopify Plus brands doing [$XX]M+, slow site speed typically costs 10-15% in lost conversions.

We've helped brands like [Similar Brand] cut load times by 40% and increase mobile conversion by 12-18% through [specific approach].

Would it be worth a quick 15-minute call to explore what might be possible for [Brand]?

Best,
[Name]

---

### Template 2: Feature Velocity Angle

**Subject:** [Brand]'s Q1 roadmap

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

Most Shopify Plus brands we talk to have a long list of features they want to ship in Q1 but are bottlenecked by dev capacity.

If [Brand] is in a similar spot, we might be able to help. We work with [X] Shopify Plus brands as their outsourced dev team, helping them ship features 2-3x faster than traditional agencies.

Recent example: [Similar Brand] wanted to launch [feature] before Black Friday. We went from brief to live in 11 days.

Open to a quick 15-minute call to see if there's a fit?

Best,
[Name]

---

### Template 3: Strategic Partner Angle

**Subject:** [Brand]'s eCommerce dev strategy

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

Quick question: Is [Brand] working with a dev agency, managing freelancers, or considering hiring in-house?

We work with a lot of Shopify Plus brands in the [$XX-XX]M revenue range who've decided that hiring a full-time dev team is too expensive/slow, but freelancers are inconsistent.

We act as an outsourced dev team — combining the speed of an agency with the strategic thinking of an in-house team.

Brands like [Similar Brand] and [Similar Brand] use us as their primary dev partner. Happy to share how it works if it's relevant.

Worth a 15-minute call?

Best,
[Name]

---

### Template 4: Case Study / Social Proof Angle

**Subject:** How [Similar Brand] scaled from $15M to $40M

**Body:**
Hi [First Name],

Saw that [Brand] is in a similar space to one of our clients, [Similar Brand].

When we started working with them in [Year], they were doing ~$15M and struggling with [specific pain point]. Fast forward to today, they're at $40M+ and we've been their dev partner the entire way.

Some things we helped with:
- [Specific outcome #1]
- [Specific outcome #2]
- [Specific outcome #3]

Not sure if [Brand] is facing similar challenges, but happy to share the full story if it's relevant.

Open to a quick call?

Best,
[Name]

## Qualifying Questions (for SQLs)

Martal should qualify leads based on these questions BEFORE passing them as SQLs:

### Qualification Criteria

**Must-Have (Disqualify if NO):**
1. ☑️ Are you on Shopify Plus (or planning to migrate in next 6 months)?
2. ☑️ Annual revenue >$10M?
3. ☑️ Do you have budget allocated for dev/agency work in Q1-Q2 2026?
4. ☑️ Are you the decision-maker or involved in the decision?

**Good-to-Have (Strong indicators):**
5. Do you currently work with a dev agency or freelancers? (If yes, what's not working?)
6. Do you have in-house developers? (If yes, how many? Are they overwhelmed?)
7. What's your top priority for Q1 2026? (site performance, new features, migration, other?)
8. Have you worked with Shopify Plus partners before?

**Disqualifying Signals:**
- Just migrated to Shopify Plus in last 6 months (unlikely to need dev yet)
- Looking for one-time project only (DYODE focuses on retainers)
- Seeking cheapest option / price shopping
- No allocated budget
- Decision timeline >6 months

---

## Handoff Process: Martal → DYODE

### What Makes a Good SQL?

**Minimum Requirements:**
- Shopify Plus (or imminent migration)
- $10M+ annual revenue

**Company Info:**
- Company name & website
- Annual revenue (estimate or range)
- Industry/vertical
- Current platform (Shopify Plus, Shopify, other)

**Contact Info:**
- Name, title, email, phone
- Decision-maker or influencer?
- Other stakeholders involved?

**Context:**
- What pain point resonated?
- What messaging/angle worked?
- Key objections or concerns raised?

---

## Success Metrics & Iteration

### Tracking Performance

**Track Monthly:**
- SQLs delivered (target: 6/month)
- SQLs converted to qualified opportunities
- Opportunities converted to closed deals
- MRR added from Martal-sourced clients

**Evaluate After Month 1 (December 2025):**
- Quality of SQLs (how many are truly qualified?)
- Messaging: What angles are resonating?
- ICP accuracy: Are we targeting the right companies?
- Response rates to outreach

**Adjust Strategy if Needed:**
- If SQL quality is low: Tighten ICP, improve qualification questions
- If response rates are low: Test new messaging angles

## Competitor Positioning

### How to Position Against Competitors

**vs. Other Shopify Plus Agencies:**
- **DYODE Advantage:** Speed, eCommerce-first focus, strategic partnership model
- **Message:** "Unlike traditional agencies that treat you like a ticket number, we act as an extension of your team"

**vs. Freelancers:**
- **DYODE Advantage:** Team depth, reliability, strategic guidance
- **Message:** "Freelancers are great for one-off projects, but if you need a reliable partner who can scale with you, you need a team"

**vs. In-House Hiring:**
- **DYODE Advantage:** Lower cost, faster ramp, no HR overhead
- **Message:** "Hiring a full-time Shopify Plus dev costs $120-150k/year + benefits + recruiting. With DYODE, you get an entire team for less."

**vs. Larger Agencies (Barrel, Haus, etc.):**
- **DYODE Advantage:** More personal, faster, less bureaucratic
- **Message:** "Large agencies come with account managers, layers of approval, and slow timelines. We're nimble and founder-led."

---

## Pricing Guidance for Martal

### What to Say About Pricing

**If Prospects Ask:**

"DYODE's retainer packages typically range from **$6,500 to $15,000 per month** depending on the scope, with most clients in the **$8-12k/month range**.

They offer flexible engagements — typically 6-month contracts to start, with the option to scale up or down based on your needs.

Happy to connect you with [DYODE Founder] to discuss specifics for your situation."

**DON'T:**
- Quote exact pricing (let DYODE handle custom pricing)

---

## Red Flags (Poor-Fit Leads)

❌ **Platform Red Flags:**
- WooCommerce, Magento, BigCommerce, Custom (not Shopify Plus)
- Shopify Basic/Standard (unless actively migrating to Plus)

❌ **Revenue Red Flags:**
- <$5M annual revenue (too small, can't afford $8-12k/month retainer)
- >$200M revenue (likely have in-house team or work with large agency)

❌ **Budget Red Flags:**
- "We're looking for the cheapest option"
- No allocated budget for 2026
- Seeking one-time project only (not retainer)

❌ **Organizational Red Flags:**
- Can't identify decision-maker
- "We're just exploring options" (no urgency)
- Junior stakeholder without authority

❌ **Technical Red Flags:**
- Heavy custom headless build (beyond DYODE's core expertise)
- Need enterprise-level dev team (10+ devs)
- Looking for offshore/low-cost development
