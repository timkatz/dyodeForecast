# Salary Freeze & Raise Unlock Framework

**Created:** December 2025
**Purpose:** Define when and how salary freeze lifts based on company performance
**Status:** APPROVED - Option A (Simple, Profit Margin Focused)

---

## Current Situation

**Salary Freeze in Effect:**
- No raises across all roles
- In place due to 3-year revenue decline and profit margin pressure
- Performance-based commissions available for client-facing roles as alternative

**Why the Freeze Matters:**
- 2025 projected revenue: $3.1-3.2M (down from $4.0M in 2024, $4.86M peak in 2022)
- Need to stabilize profitability before increasing fixed costs (salaries)
- Salaries are permanent cost increases; need sustainable profit margin first

---

## The Path to Unlock Raises

### Principle: Raises Unlock When Profit Margin is Healthy and Sustainable

**Key Metrics:**
1. **Profit Margin %** - Primary trigger
2. **MRR Growth** - Secondary indicator (shows momentum)
3. **Sustainability** - Must maintain for 2+ consecutive quarters

**Philosophy:**
- Growth alone doesn't unlock raises (we could grow revenue but remain unprofitable)
- **Profit margin health** is what allows sustainable salary increases
- Commission earnings in 2026 don't count against raise eligibility (everyone evaluated on total contribution)

---

## Raise Unlock Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Early Unlock (Mid-2026) ✅ Best Case

**Trigger:** Profit margin hits **[X%]*** for Q2 2026 AND Q3 2026 (2 consecutive quarters)

**Timeline:**
- Q2 2026 results reviewed: July 2026
- Q3 2026 results reviewed: October 2026
- If both quarters hit target → **Raises effective Q4 2026 (Oct/Nov 2026)**

**What this means:**
- MRR growth programs (cross-sells, referrals, Martal) are working
- New clients are sticking (retention improving)
- Profit margin is healthy and stable
- Company can afford permanent salary increases

**Raise Pool:**
- 3-5% merit-based raises for all employees
- Performance-differentiated (top performers get higher %, average get standard)
- Total pool: ~[X%] of total annual salaries

**Example:**
- Top performer: 5% raise
- Strong performer: 4% raise
- Solid performer: 3% raise
- Underperformer: 0-2% raise or none

---

### Scenario 2: Standard Unlock (Early 2027) ⚠️ Base Case

**Trigger:** Profit margin hits **[X%]*** for Q3 2026 AND Q4 2026 (2 consecutive quarters)

**Timeline:**
- Q3 2026 results reviewed: October 2026
- Q4 2026 results reviewed: January 2027
- If both quarters hit target → **Raises effective Q1 2027 (Jan/Feb 2027)**

**What this means:**
- Growth is happening but took longer to stabilize
- Profit margin didn't hit target until later in year
- Still validates the strategy worked

**Raise Pool:**
- 3-5% merit-based raises for all employees
- Performance-differentiated
- Total pool: ~[X%] of total annual salaries

---

### Scenario 3: Delayed Unlock (Mid-2027) ⚠️ If Growth is Slower

**Trigger:** Profit margin hits **[X%]*** for Q1 2027 AND Q2 2027 (2 consecutive quarters)

**Timeline:**
- Q1 2027 results reviewed: April 2027
- Q2 2027 results reviewed: July 2027
- If both quarters hit target → **Raises effective Q3 2027 (July/Aug 2027)**

**What this means:**
- Growth took longer than expected
- Company is being conservative to ensure sustainability
- Once profit margin stabilizes, raises unlock

**Raise Pool:**
- 3-5% merit-based raises
- May include "catch-up" component for long freeze period

---

### Scenario 4: Freeze Remains ❌ If Targets Not Met

**If:** Profit margin does NOT hit target by end of 2027

**Actions:**
- Co-founders reassess strategy and make adjustments
- May implement selective raises for critical retention risks
- Communicate revised timeline and what needs to change

**This is unlikely if 2026 growth plan executes well.**

---

## What Counts Toward Raises (Performance Evaluation)

### Everyone is Evaluated on Total Contribution (Not Just Commission Earnings)

**Client-Facing Roles (Who Can Earn Commissions):**
- Commission earnings in 2026 do NOT penalize you for raises
- Raises are based on:
  - Overall client management quality
  - Retention performance (did your clients stick?)
  - Team collaboration
  - Client satisfaction
  - Cross-sells, referrals, reviews (shows initiative)
  - Delivery quality

**Example:**
- PM earns $8k in commissions in 2026 from cross-sells
- Also maintains 95% client retention, delivers excellent projects
- When raises unlock, PM is evaluated on ALL contributions (not penalized for commission earnings)
- PM could get 4-5% raise on top of commissions earned

---

**Non-Client-Facing Roles (Who Can't Earn Commissions):**
- Raises are based on:
  - Team leadership and coaching effectiveness
  - Did your team hit their goals? (PMs cross-selling, devs delivering quality)
  - Operational improvements
  - Process efficiency
  - Strategic contributions
  - Cross-functional collaboration

**Example:**
- Director of Project Management coaches PMs to hit 6 cross-sells in 2026
- Improves project delivery processes, increases team efficiency
- When raises unlock, Director gets 4-5% merit raise based on team success and leadership

---

### Key Message: **Everyone Benefits from Company Success**

- Client-facing roles: Earn commissions in 2026 + raises when freeze lifts
- Non-client-facing roles: No commissions in 2026, but raises reflect total contributions when freeze lifts
- Directors already earn higher base salaries (so not getting commissions is balanced by higher pay)
- When raises unlock, performance is evaluated holistically (not just "who made commissions")

## Historical Profit Margin Context

### DYODE Profit Margin History (2018-2025)

| Year | Revenue | Expenses | Profit | Other Income | **Profit Margin** |
|------|---------|----------|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| 2018 | $1.71M | $1.04M | $651k | - | **38%** |
| 2019 | $1.73M | $1.07M | $659k | - | **38%** |
| 2020 | $2.64M | $1.84M | $803k | - | **30%** |
| 2021 | $3.73M | $3.52M | $204k | - | **5.5%** |
| 2022 | $4.86M | $4.51M | $348k | $7k | **7.3%** |
| 2023 | $4.71M | $4.41M | $299k | $29k | **7.0%** |
| 2024 | $4.00M | $3.65M | $348k | -$17k | **8.3%** |
| **2025 YTD** | **$2.85M** | **$2.87M** | **-$27k** | **$34k** | **0.3%** |

**What This Shows:**

**2018-2019: Not Comparable (Accounting Change)**
- 38% profit margins **do not include co-founder salaries**
- Changed accounting in 2020 to properly factor co-founder comp
- **These years are not a realistic baseline**

**2020: Pandemic Growth + Hiring at Premium**
- Revenue jumped to $2.64M (+53%)
- Accounting change: Now includes co-founder salaries
- Hired aggressively during pandemic (bidding war for developers, higher salaries)
- Added PMs, coordinators, operations staff to support growth
- Margin dropped to 30% (but this is first "true" margin with proper accounting)
- $803k profit (best ever in absolute dollars)

**2021-2022: Peak Revenue, Team Scales Up**
- Revenue grew to $3.7M → $4.86M (peak)
- Hired more at premium salaries (competitive market for dev talent)
- Expenses: $3.5M → $4.5M
- Margins: 5.5% → 7.3%
- **The team scaled for $5M+ business**

**2023-2024: Revenue Decline, Cost Cutting, Morale Balancing**
- Revenue declined from $4.86M → $4.0M
- **April 2024: Laid off 10 people** to reduce expenses (tough decision)
- **October 2024: Gave raises** to remaining team (balancing morale after layoffs)
- Expenses: $4.4M → $3.65M (14% reduction)
- Margin: 8.3% (set first profit margin goal of 10%, came close)
- Still challenge: Team sized for bigger business, but made progress

**2025: Turbulence Year**
- Set aggressive 15% margin goal (business seemed to be picking up)
- **April 2025: Tariffs hit, business slowed dramatically**
- **Early 2025: Forecasted -$200k profit loss** (crisis mode)
- **Froze raises** when performance deteriorated
- **Laid off 2 developers** to cut costs further
- **Year-end: Caught back up to flat** (avoided projected -$200k loss)
- Revenue on track for ~$3.4M (down 15% from 2024)
- Expenses: $2.87M YTD
- **0.3% profit margin (essentially breakeven)**
- Operating loss of -$27k, saved only by $34k other income

**What the Team Has Been Through:**
- April 2024: Layoffs (10 people)
- Oct 2024: Raises (morale boost)
- 2025: Raises frozen (performance decline)
- 2025: More layoffs (2 developers)
- **This has been incredibly turbulent for a small team**

**Key Takeaways:**
- **True baseline (2020-2024): 6-8% margins** with proper accounting and market salaries
- **2024 was best year in recent history:** 8.3% margin after 10 layoffs, gave raises in October
- **2025 external shock:** Tariffs derailed progress, forecasted -$200k loss
- **2025 recovery:** Avoided $200k loss through cost control, ended at breakeven (0.3% margin)
- **Team has been through a lot:** Layoffs (April 2024) → Raises (Oct 2024) → Freeze (2025) → More layoffs (2 devs)
- **2026 opportunity:** Get to 12-15% with growth plan + controlled expenses, unlock raises

---

## Profit Margin Target for Raise Unlock

### Target: 12-15% Profit Margin for 2 Consecutive Quarters

**Why 12-15%?**

✅ **Realistic improvement from current baseline:**
- 2024 achieved 8.3% (close to 10% goal)
- 12-15% is roughly 1.5-2x improvement over 2024
- Not comparing to 2018-2019 (those margins didn't include co-founder salaries)

✅ **Achievable with execution:**
- If 2026 revenue plan hits $4.2M ($1.05M/quarter)
- AND expenses stay controlled at ~$900-920k/quarter
- We hit 13-14% margins

✅ **Accounts for lessons learned:**
- 2024: Set 10% goal, hit 8.3% (close)
- 2025: Set 15% goal, tariffs hit, ended at 0.3%
- 2026: 12-15% target accounts for external risks

✅ **Sustainable:**
- Not trying to get back to 30% (2020 was unique pandemic circumstances)
- 12-15% provides healthy buffer for raises without risking profitability
- Allows room for market volatility

**What This Means in Dollars:**

| Scenario | 2026 Revenue | Target Margin | Annual Profit | Quarterly Profit |
|----------|--------------|---------------|---------------|------------------|
| Conservative (12%) | $4.0M | 12% | $480k | $120k |
| Base Case (13-14%) | $4.2M | 13.5% | $567k | $142k |
| Aggressive (15%) | $4.4M | 15% | $660k | $165k |

**Compare to Recent History:**
- 2024 profit: $331k (8.3% margin)
- 2025 profit: $7.5k (0.3% margin) 😬
- **Target 2026:** $480-660k (12-15% margin)

**To unlock raises, we need to get from 0.3% margin to 12-15% margin.**

---

### Unlock Criteria (REVISED - Learned from 2024/2025)

**Why We Changed from 2 Quarters to 3 Quarters:**

**What happened in 2024-2025:**
- Oct 2024: Hit profit margin target for 2 consecutive quarters → Gave raises
- Q4 2024 - Q3 2025: Never sustained the margin
- Q4 2025: Collapsed to 0.1% margin (from 8.5% in Q3)
- **Lesson: 2 consecutive quarters isn't enough to prove sustainability**

**2025 Quarterly Profit Margins (Actual):**
- Q1 2025: 1.3%
- Q2 2025: 5.5% (improving!)
- Q3 2025: 8.5% (almost to 10% goal!)
- Q4 2025: 0.1% (COLLAPSED back to breakeven)

**This volatility is the real problem. Two good quarters can be followed by a collapse.**

---

### NEW Unlock Criteria: 3 Consecutive Quarters (More Conservative)

**Raises unlock when:**
- Company achieves **12%+ profit margin for 3 consecutive quarters**
- OR achieves **12%+ full-year average margin**

**Specific Thresholds:**
- **Minimum to unlock raises:** 12% profit margin
- **Target range:** 13-14% profit margin
- **Stretch goal:** 15%+ profit margin

**Earliest unlock scenarios:**

**Scenario 1: Q2 + Q3 + Q4 2026 all hit 12%+**
- ✅ **Raises unlock Q1 2027 (effective Jan/Feb 2027)**
- 15 months from Oct 2024 raises

**Scenario 2: Q3 + Q4 2026 + Q1 2027 all hit 12%+**
- ✅ **Raises unlock Q2 2027 (effective Apr/May 2027)**
- 18 months from Oct 2024 raises

**Scenario 3: Full-year 2026 average hits 12%+ (even if no 3 consecutive quarters)**
- ✅ **Raises unlock Q1 2027 (effective Jan/Feb 2027)**
- Rewards sustained annual performance, not just quarterly spikes

---

### Why 3 Consecutive Quarters (Not 2)?

**Protects against volatility:**
- 2025 proved you can have 2 improving quarters (Q2+Q3) then collapse (Q4)
- 3 consecutive quarters proves it's not a fluke
- Reduces risk of giving raises, then freezing again (painful whiplash)

**Proves sustainability:**
- If you can maintain 12%+ for 3 quarters, you've fundamentally fixed the business model
- Not just riding a good quarter or two
- External shocks (like Q4 2025 slowdown) won't derail you as easily

**Gives team realistic expectations:**
- Transparent: "We need 3 quarters, not 2"
- Clear progress tracking: "We hit Q2, now need Q3+Q4"
- No false hope (like Oct 2024 raises that had to be frozen)

---

## Year-End Performance Bonuses (Shorter-Term Wins)

### The Problem: Waiting 15-24 Months Feels Endless

**Timeline challenge:**
- Last raise: Oct 2024
- Next raise (best case): Jan 2027 (15 months)
- Next raise (likely): Apr-Jul 2027 (18-21 months)

**Risk:**
- Team feels like there's no opportunity in sight
- Top performers start looking elsewhere
- Morale stays low throughout 2026

**Solution:**
- **Year-end performance bonuses** (January 2027)
- Rewards progress, not just hitting absolute targets
- Paid AFTER full year (no risk of premature payment like Oct 2024)
- Gives team SOMETHING within 14 months

---

### 2026 Year-End Bonus Structure (Graduated)

**Paid:** January 2027 (after full 2026 results are in)
**Based on:** 2026 full-year average profit margin

| 2026 Full-Year Avg Margin | Bonus Per Person | Total Cost (40 people) | Message |
|---------------------------|------------------|----------------------|---------|
| 0-3% (no improvement) | $0 | $0 | "We didn't improve" |
| 4-6% (modest improvement) | $400 | ~$16k | "Progress made, keep going" |
| 7-9% (significant improvement) | $750 | ~$30k | "Heading in right direction" |
| 10-11% (close to goal) | $1,250 | ~$50k | "Almost there!" |
| 12%+ (goal achieved!) | $2,000 | ~$80k | "Goal achieved!" |

**Why this works:**

✅ **Rewards progress, not perfection**
- Even if you only hit 8% average (double 2025's ~4%), team gets $750
- Shows appreciation for improvement, not just hitting 12%

✅ **Paid after full year**
- No risk of giving bonus in July then collapsing in Q4 (like 2025: 8.5% → 0.1%)
- January 2027 payment means 2026 results are final

✅ **Graduated structure**
- Not "all or nothing" (hit 12% or get nothing)
- Every level of improvement is recognized

✅ **Gives team SOMETHING within 14 months**
- Oct 2024 raises → Jan 2027 bonus = 14 months
- Much better than "wait 18-24 months for raises with nothing in between"

✅ **Still conservative on raises**
- Bonuses are one-time (not permanent salary increases)
- Raises still require 3 consecutive quarters at 12%+ (sustainability proven)

---

### Example Scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Strong Execution (Best Case)**
- 2026 quarterly margins: Q1 6%, Q2 10%, Q3 13%, Q4 14%
- Full-year average: **10.75%**
- **January 2027:** $1,250 bonus per person (~$50k total)
- **Q2 2027:** Raises unlock (Q2+Q3+Q4 all hit 12%+)
- **Team gets:** $1,250 bonus + 3-5% raise

**Scenario 2: Moderate Progress**
- 2026 quarterly margins: Q1 5%, Q2 8%, Q3 10%, Q4 7%
- Full-year average: **7.5%**
- **January 2027:** $750 bonus per person (~$30k total)
- **Raises:** Don't unlock yet (didn't hit 3 consecutive quarters at 12%)
- **Team gets:** $750 bonus, recognition for progress, need to sustain in 2027

**Scenario 3: Slow Start, Strong Finish**
- 2026 quarterly margins: Q1 4%, Q2 7%, Q3 12%, Q4 13%
- Full-year average: **9%**
- **January 2027:** $750 bonus per person (~$30k total)
- **Q1 2027:** If hits 12%+ → Raises unlock Q2 2027 (Q3+Q4+Q1 = 3 consecutive quarters)
- **Team gets:** $750 bonus + raises a few months later

**Scenario 4: Similar to 2025 (Volatile)**
- 2026 quarterly margins: Q1 3%, Q2 6%, Q3 9%, Q4 2%
- Full-year average: **5%**
- **January 2027:** $400 bonus per person (~$16k total)
- **Message:** "We improved over 2025 (~4% avg), but we need more stability. Here's appreciation for the effort."

---

### Budget Planning:

**Conservative estimate (7-9% average):** ~$30k
**Base case estimate (10-11% average):** ~$50k
**Best case estimate (12%+ average):** ~$80k

**Plus eventual raises (when unlock):** ~$70-100k annual

**Total 2-year compensation investment:** ~$100-180k
- Year 1 (2026): Bonuses only
- Year 2 (2027): Raises kick in (if criteria met)

---

## Combined Approach: Bonuses + Raises

### Timeline for Team:

**Throughout 2026:**
- Monthly town hall: Transparent profit margin updates
- Quarterly deep dives: Progress review
- Public recognition: Cross-sells, referrals, reviews, excellent delivery

**January 2027:**
- Calculate 2026 full-year average margin
- Pay year-end performance bonuses (graduated structure)
- Communicate progress toward raise unlock

**Q1-Q2 2027:**
- If 3 consecutive quarters hit 12%+ → Raises unlock
- If not yet → Continue executing, reevaluate quarterly

**Message to team:**
> "You won't wait with nothing. If we execute well in 2026, you'll get a performance bonus in January 2027. If we prove sustainability (3 quarters at 12%+), raises unlock shortly after. We're balancing short-term appreciation with long-term sustainability."

---



### Transparent Timeline Communication

**What to tell the team NOW (January 2026):**

> "We're currently in a salary freeze. We know this is difficult. Here's the full picture:
>
> **What you've been through:** This has been an incredibly turbulent 18 months. In April 2024, we laid off 10 people. In October 2024, we gave raises to the remaining team. Then in 2025, when tariffs hit and business slowed, we had to freeze raises and lay off 2 more developers. Earlier this year, we were forecasted to lose $200k. Through hard work and cost control, we avoided that and ended at breakeven (0.1% profit margin in Q4).
>
> **The reality:** We can't sustain salary increases at 0-1% profit margins. We need to get healthy again.
>
> **What we learned:** In October 2024, we gave raises after hitting our margin target for 2 consecutive quarters. Then 2025 showed us that wasn't enough:
> - Q1 2025: 1.3% margin
> - Q2 2025: 5.5% margin (improving!)
> - Q3 2025: 8.5% margin (almost to 10% goal!)
> - Q4 2025: 0.1% margin (collapsed back to breakeven)
>
> **Two good quarters doesn't mean sustainability.** We need to prove we can maintain healthy margins, not just hit them briefly.
>
> **The 2026 plan:**
>
> **SHORT-TERM (Year-End Bonuses):**
> - Based on 2026 full-year average profit margin
> - Paid January 2027 (14 months from now)
> - Graduated structure that rewards progress:
>   - 4-6% average: $400 per person
>   - 7-9% average: $750 per person
>   - 10-11% average: $1,250 per person
>   - 12%+ average: $2,000 per person
>
> **LONG-TERM (Raises):**
> - Unlock when we hit 12%+ margin for 3 consecutive quarters (not 2)
> - OR when 2026 full-year average hits 12%+
> - 3-5% merit-based raises, performance-differentiated
> - Earliest unlock: Q1 2027 (if Q2+Q3+Q4 2026 all hit 12%+)
>
> **Why this approach:**
> - Year-end bonus gives you SOMETHING in 14 months (not endless waiting)
> - Rewards progress, not just hitting absolute targets
> - Raises require 3 quarters (not 2) to prove sustainability
> - Protects against repeating Oct 2024 (raises then freeze)
>
> **Transparency:** We'll share profit margin progress every month so you see exactly where we stand.
>
> **We're in this together:** You avoided a $200k loss in 2025. If we execute our 2026 plan and hit 8-10% average margin, you'll get a year-end bonus. If we hit 12%+ for 3 quarters, raises unlock. Your hard work directly impacts both."

---

### Quarterly Updates (Recommended)

**Share these metrics at town halls:**
- "Our profit margin this quarter was [X]%"
- "We need to hit 12-15% for 2 consecutive quarters to unlock raises"
- "We're [on track / ahead / behind] to unlock raises by [Q4 2026 / Q1 2027]"
- "Here's what's working / what needs to improve"

**Example Q2 2026 Update:**
> "Q1 2026 profit margin was 5% (up from 0.3% in 2025, but not yet at our 12% target). We added 3 new clients from Martal, closed 2 cross-sells, and MRR grew to $315k. We're on track to hit 12% by Q3 2026 if momentum continues."

**Example Q3 2026 Update (Good News):**
> "Q2 2026 profit margin was 10%, Q3 2026 was 13%. We need one more quarter at 12%+ to unlock raises. If Q4 2026 maintains 12%+, raises will be effective in October/November."

**Why this matters:**
- Creates transparency and trust
- Gives team visibility into progress
- Motivates execution (they can see the path to raises)
- Reduces anxiety and speculation
- Team knows EXACTLY what needs to happen

---

## Example Timeline (If Plan Executes Well)

### Realistic Profit Margin Progression

**Q4 2025 (Oct-Dec):**
- Current state: 0.3% profit margin (breakeven)
- Revenue: ~$800k for quarter

- 3-5% merit-based raises implemented
- Team morale boost heading into 2027
- Company on sustainable growth trajectory

---

### If Growth Takes Longer (Conservative Timeline)

**Q1-Q2 2026:**
- Slower ramp, profit margin stays at 8-10%
- Not quite hitting 12% target

**Q3 2026:**
- Programs gain momentum
- **Profit margin: 11%** (close but not quite 12%)

**Q4 2026:**
- Continued improvement
- **Profit margin: 13%** ✅ **(First qualifying quarter)**

**Q1 2027:**
- Sustained execution
- **Profit margin: 13-14%** ✅ **(Second qualifying quarter)**

**Result:**
- ✅ **RAISES UNLOCK Q1 2027** (effective Jan/Feb 2027)
- Still a win, just took one extra quarter

## FAQ for Team

**Q: If I earn commissions in 2026, will I get a smaller raise when the freeze lifts?**
A: No. Raises are performance-based on your total contribution, not penalized by commission earnings. You could earn $8k in commissions AND get a 5% raise.

**Q: What if I don't have a commission opportunity? Is that fair?**
A: Commission opportunities are tied to client-facing roles. Directors earn higher base salaries. When raises unlock, everyone is evaluated on their total contribution to company success (not just commissions).

**Q: What if we don't hit the profit margin target?**
A: We'll reassess and communicate a revised timeline. The 2026 plan is designed to hit targets. If we execute well, raises should unlock by end of 2026 or early 2027.

**Q: Can co-founders do selective raises before the freeze lifts?**
A: In rare cases (critical retention risk, promotion, role change), yes. But the general freeze remains until profit margin targets are hit.

**Q: Will directors get bigger raises since they didn't get commissions?**
A: Raises are merit-based on performance, not compensation for lack of commissions. Top performers (director or not) get higher raises. Average performers get standard raises.

**Q: How will performance be evaluated for raises?**
A: Holistically. Client-facing roles: retention, client satisfaction, delivery quality, initiative (cross-sells, referrals). Non-client-facing: team leadership, process improvements, strategic contributions.

## Action Items for Co-Founders

### ✅ Decisions Made:

1. **Profit margin target:** 12-15% for 2 consecutive quarters
2. **Unlock criteria:** 2 consecutive quarters (Q3+Q4 2026 or Q4 2026+Q1 2027)
3. **Raise pool:** 3-5% merit-based range, performance-differentiated

### 🔲 Remaining Decisions:

1. **Communication timing:**
   - Announce framework in December 2025 (transparency, sets expectations)
   - OR wait until Q1 2026 kickoff (less pressure during holidays)
   - **Recommendation:** Announce in early January 2026 (after holidays, before programs launch)

2. **Quarterly review process:**
   - Who reviews profit margin? → Recommendation: Co-founders + Director of Ops
   - How communicated? → Recommendation: Monthly town hall (10 min update)
   - When reviewed? → First week of new quarter (Jan, Apr, Jul, Oct)

3. **Raise pool budget approval:**
   - Total pool as % of annual salaries? → Recommendation: 3-4% of total salary budget
   - Example: If total salaries are $2M/year, raise pool is $60-80k
   - Differentiated: Top performers get 5%, average get 3%, underperformers get 0-2%

## Appendix: Why This Framework Works

### For the Company:
- Ensures raises are sustainable (tied to profitability, not just revenue)
- Prevents premature salary increases that could hurt cash flow
- Aligns entire team toward profit margin goal
- Clear criteria (no arbitrary decisions)

### For the Team:
- Transparency about when freeze lifts (not indefinite)
- Clear path to raises (everyone knows the target)
- Fair evaluation (commissions don't penalize you)
- Quarterly updates (visibility into progress)
- Hope and motivation (execute well = raises unlock sooner)

### For Directors (Non-Client-Facing):
- Acknowledges they already earn higher base salary
- Raises will reflect their contributions (coaching, leadership, process improvement)
- No penalty for not having commission opportunity
- When raises unlock, they're evaluated fairly on total impact
