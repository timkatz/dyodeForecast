### Current State & January 2026 Baseline
- **December 2025 MRR (All Services):** $245k (confirmed, includes GST project)
- **December 2025 Recurring MRR (Retainers Only):** ~$227k (excluding GST project ~$17.7k/month)

## Monthly Review Process

**Every Month:**
1. Track new clients/MRR by channel
2. Review pipeline and conversion rates
3. Assess churn and at-risk accounts
4. Update 2026 YTD progress toward quarterly/annual targets
5. Share results with team (% to goal, not dollars)

**Every Quarter:**
1. Evaluate channel performance vs. targets
2. Make decisions on channels to continue/pivot
3. Adjust next quarter strategy if needed
4. Celebrate wins, learn from misses

**Decision Points:**
- **Jan 2026:** Martal pilot results (renew or pivot)
- **Mar 2026:** Q1 performance (on pace for $381k?)
- **Jun 2026:** Martal renewal + Q2 performance
- **Sep 2026:** Q3 performance + Plus migration progress
- **Dec 2026:** Full year results + 2027 planning

## Appendix: 2026 Baseline Recalculation (Great Star Tools Project)

### Why the Baseline Changed

**Great Star Tools Development Project:**
- **Project Value:** $212,750
- **Project Timeline:** 5/1/2025 - 5/1/2026 (one-time project)
- **Monthly Equivalent:** ~$17,729/month
- **Status:** Completed 5/1/2025, does NOT continue into 2026

**Impact on December 2025 MRR:**
The confirmed $245k December MRR includes the GST project revenue (~$17.7k). This creates a one-time spike that doesn't recur in January 2026.

**December 2025 Breakdown:**
- Recurring retainers (dev, marketing, consulting): ~$227k
- GST project remaining balance: ~$17.7k
- **Total: ~$245k**

**January 2026 Breakdown:**
- Recurring retainers less GST dev reduction: ~$223k
- GST project: $0 (ended)
- **Total: ~$223k**

### Updated 2026 Growth Calculations

**Starting Point Correction:**

| Metric | Previous Calc | Corrected | Difference |
|--------|---------------|-----------|-----------|
| Jan 2026 MRR Baseline | $241k | $223k | -$18k |
| Growth Needed to $381k | $140k | $158k | +$18k |
| Growth % Required | 58% | 71% | +13 ppts |
| New Business Required | $255k | $273k | +$18k |

**Key Changes:**
1. **Baseline is lower by $18k** - GST project not repeating in 2026
2. **Growth targets are higher by $18k** - Must add more new business to hit $381k
3. **Churn impact is same** - ~$115k estimated annual churn from current base

### What This Means for Execution

**Good News:**
- $273k new business requirement is specific and achievable
- 7 channels provide diverse ways to hit target
- Average deal size of $7-8k means 35-40 new clients needed (attainable)

**Reality Check:**
- Cannot rely on any one-time project revenue
- 2026 is about sustainable recurring revenue
- GST retainer reduction ($3.75k) is permanent starting Jan 2026

### Monthly Impact Throughout 2026

**Q1-Q4 baseline assumes:**
- January: Start at $223k recurring (no GST project)
- Add monthly new business from all channels
- Subtract estimated churn (~$9-10k/month)
- Net growth each month to progress toward $381k year-end

This is why consistent monthly execution across all 7 channels is critical—there's no recurring revenue cushion from projects.
