### 4. Key Client Updates & Revenue Risks

#### High-Value Client Risks:

**Glenmorangie ($22,500 current MRR) - SIGNIFICANT RISK**
- **Payment Model:** 150-hour buckets at $150/hr ($22,500 per payment)
- **2025 Pattern:** Paid 7 times (Jan, Mar, Apr, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep), Q3 paid monthly ($22,500/month)
- **Historical:** Typically pays quarterly (~$22,500/quarter)
- **Recent Trend:** Slowed significantly in Oct/Nov - engagement declining
- **2026 Forecast:** Conservative quarterly model = $7,500/month average
- **Potential Impact:** -$15,000/month if reverting to normal quarterly cadence
- **Action:** Proactive engagement to understand needs, propose retainer model

**Wyze ($16,800 current MRR) - MODERATE RISK**
- **Current:** 140 hours/month at $120/hr (Q3-Q4 2025 increase from 70 hours)
- **Risk:** Client mentioned wanting to hire in-house Shopify developer
- **Potential Impact:** Could drop to $8,400/month (original 70 hours) or less in Q1
- **Conservative Forecast:** Assume drop to $12,600/month (105 hours) in Q1 2026
- **Potential Loss:** -$4,200/month
- **Action:** Demonstrate unique value, propose strategic work beyond dev hours

**SiO Beauty ($7,500 current project) - OPPORTUNITY**
- **Current:** One-time Black Friday theme rush project (ending 12/4/25)
- **Opportunity:** Client interested in Q1 2026 continuation
  - Option A: Custom theme build (no rush) - likely $15-25k project
  - Option B: Ongoing retainer - target $5-8k/month
- **Preferred Path:** Convert to retainer for stable MRR
- **Action:** Proposal ready before project delivery in December

**Updated Revenue Risk Assessment:**
- Glenmorangie normalization: -$15,000/month (likely)
- Wyze reduction: -$4,200/month (possible)
- SiO Beauty opportunity: +$5-8k/month (if converted)
- **Net Q1 Impact:** -$13k to -$19k/month potential headwind

#### 2025 Churn Rate by Service

**Development:**
- Starting clients: ~25
- Added: 10
- Lost: 11
- **Net change: -1**
- **Churn rate: ~44%** (extremely high)

**Marketing:**
- Starting clients: ~18
- Added: 6
- Lost: 10
- **Net change: -4**
- **Churn rate: ~56%** (critical)

**Consulting:**
- Starting clients: ~5
- Added: 3
- Lost: 3
- **Net change: 0**
- **Churn rate: ~60%** (unsustainable)

**Overall 2025 Churn Analysis:**
- **Total clients lost:** 24
- **Total clients added:** 17
- **Net client change:** -7
- **Overall churn rate:** ~35-40% (industry average: 15-20%)

#### Root Causes of High Churn:
1. **High project dependency** (26% of revenue - projects naturally end)
2. **Too many month-to-month contracts** (24% of MRR - no commitment)
3. **Economic headwinds** (inflation, tariffs impacting eCommerce clients)
4. **Lack of systematic lead generation** (organic only until Nov 2025)
5. **Insufficient retention processes** (no formal QBRs, renewal outreach)
6. **Quality of client fit** (some clients may not be ideal long-term fits)

#### Impact on 2026 Strategy:

This churn analysis directly informs our 2026 priorities:

1. **Reduce churn from 35% to 20%** through better retention processes
2. **Shift from month-to-month to minimum 6-month terms** for all new clients
3. **Build systematic sales pipeline** (Martal lead gen launched 11/1/25)
4. **Improve client quality** through better qualification
5. **Convert projects to retainers** (like Satechi model)
6. **Target 25-30 new clients** to offset expected churn and grow

### 6. Revenue Decline Trend

**Historical Revenue:**
| Year | Revenue | YoY Change | % Change |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| 2018 | $1,705,056 | - | - |
| 2019 | $1,732,241 | +$27,185 | +1.6% |
| 2020 | $2,644,745 | +$912,504 | +52.7% (Pandemic boom) |
| 2021 | $3,725,201 | +$1,080,456 | +40.8% |
| 2022 | $4,856,392 | +$1,131,191 | +30.4% (Peak) |
| 2023 | $4,708,631 | -$147,761 | -3.0% |
| 2024 | $3,995,372 | -$713,259 | -15.1% |
| 2025 (est) | $3,200,000 | -$795,372 | -19.9% |

**Key Insights:**
- **Peak Revenue:** $4.86M in 2022
- **Current Trajectory:** Down 34% from peak over 3 years (-$1.66M)
- **2022-2023:** Modest decline (-3%) - manageable
- **2023-2024:** Accelerated decline (-15%) - concerning
- **2024-2025:** Further acceleration (-20%) - critical
- **Urgency:** Must reverse trend in 2026 to avoid further erosion and return toward $4M+ levels

---

## 2026 Strategic Plan

### Overall Goal: Reverse Decline & Return to Growth

**Target End 2026 MRR:** $381,496
**Projected 2026 Annual Revenue:** $4.1M - $4.2M

**Growth Metrics:**
| Metric | Amount | Percentage |
|--------|--------|------------|
| MRR Growth | +$121,496 | 46.7% |
| Revenue Growth | +$1.0M | 32% |

### Strategic Priorities

#### 1. CRITICAL: Maintain Shopify Plus Partner Status (Premium or Platinum)

**Current Status:** At risk - only 2 Shopify Plus projects closed in past 2 years

**Requirements:**
- **Premium Partner:** 4 Shopify Plus projects every 2 years
- **Platinum Partner:** 6 Shopify Plus projects every 2 years

**Why This Matters:**
- Majority of revenue comes from Shopify merchants
- Partner badge drives inbound leads and credibility
- Access to Shopify partner referrals and co-marketing
- Competitive advantage in sales process

**2026 Target:** Close minimum 4-6 Shopify Plus projects

**Strategy:**
- Prioritize Shopify Plus prospects in sales pipeline
- Leverage Martal lead gen to target Shopify Plus brands specifically
- Partner with Shopify Plus sales team for referrals
- Create Shopify Plus-specific case studies and positioning
- Attend Shopify events and partner summits

**Tracking:** Must monitor Shopify Plus project closes quarterly

---

#### 2. Stabilize Revenue Base (Q1 2026 - Critical)
- **Convert month-to-month to contracts** ($67k at risk)
- **Save Q4 2025 expiring contracts** ($39k at risk)
- **Replace project revenue** ($63k ending)
- **Target:** Minimize churn, secure base

#### 2. Build Systematic Sales Engine

**Lead Gen Agency (Martal) - Launched 11/1/25:**

**Contract Terms:**
  - 3-month pilot: Nov 2025 - Jan 2026
  - Guaranteed: 18 Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs)

**REALISTIC Timeline & Expectations:**

Month 1 (November 2025):
- Agency setup, list building, initial outreach
- First SQLs delivered late November
- **Expected:** 2-4 SQLs, 0-1 closes

Month 2 (December 2025):
- Continued SQL delivery
- November SQLs in sales process
- Holiday slowdown affects close rates
- **Expected:** 6-8 SQLs, 1-2 closes

Month 3 (January 2026):
- Final SQL delivery (complete 18 guarantee)
- December SQLs in sales process
- Some November SQLs closing
- **Expected:** 8-10 SQLs, 2-3 closes

Post-Pilot (Feb-March 2026):
- Closing lag: January SQLs close in Feb-Mar
- **Expected:** 2-4 additional closes

**Realistic Martal Impact:**
- **Q1 Closes:** 3-6 clients (not 6-8)
- **Q2 Closes:** 2-4 clients (lag effect)
- **Total from 18 SQLs:** 5-10 clients over 6 months
- **Effective Close Rate:** 28-56% (over time, not immediately)
- **Q1 MRR from Martal:** $22.5k - $45k (lower than originally estimated)

**Key Reality Check:**
- SQLs delivered ≠ immediate closes
- Average sales cycle: 30-60 days
- Holiday season (Dec) slows decision-making
- Q1 budget conversations delay January closes
- Must supplement with other lead sources

---

**eCommerce Agency Buying Seasonality:**

Understanding when brands invest in agency services:

**Q1 (Jan-Mar) - SLOW START:**
- January: Budgets approved but slow decision-making, post-holiday recovery
- February: Activity picks up, planning mode
- March: Stronger, preparing for Q2 initiatives
- **Typical Pattern:** Longer sales cycles, more conservative

**Q2 (Apr-Jun) - STRONG:**
- Fresh annual budgets being deployed
- Mid-year planning and optimization
- Pre-summer sales preparation
- **Typical Pattern:** Faster decisions, higher close rates

**Q3 (Jul-Sep) - MODERATE:**
- July-August: Summer slowdown, vacations
- September: Ramp up for holiday season
- **Typical Pattern:** Mixed - slow then accelerates

**Q4 (Oct-Dec) - MIXED:**
- October-November: Budget flush (use it or lose it), holiday prep
- Black Friday/Cyber Monday focus
- December: Planning next year, holiday shutdowns
- **Typical Pattern:** High urgency Oct-Nov, dead December

**Implication for 2026 Targets:**
- Q1 targets must account for slower buying cycle
- Q2 is prime time for agency sales
- Build pipeline in Q1 to close in Q2
- Front-load outreach to overcome Q1 headwinds

---

**Founder-Led Sales (Continuing):**
  - Leverage existing relationships and referrals
  - Focus on happy client referral program
  - Shopify/BigCommerce partner channels
  - Direct outreach to target accounts
  - **Target:** 1-2 clients/month from non-Martal sources

**Future Consideration:**
  - Hire dedicated Sales Executive if Martal proves successful (Q2/Q3 decision)
  - Budget: $90-130k base + 8-10% commission on new business
  - Alternative: Extend Martal contract if ROI positive

#### 3. Reduce Churn from 35% to 20%
- Implement quarterly business reviews (QBRs) for all $10k+ clients
- 90-day renewal outreach before contract expiration
- Contract requirement: Minimum 6-month terms (no more month-to-month for new clients)
- Auto-renewal clauses with 60-day notice
- Annual prepay discount: 10% off for annual payment

#### 4. Shift Contract Mix
- **Current:** 74% Retainer / 26% Project
- **Target 2026:** 85% Retainer / 15% Project

**Strategy:**
- Convert projects to retainers (like Satechi model)
- Offer maintenance retainers to project clients
- Focus sales on retainer engagements

#### 5. Service Strategy by Type

**Development (Target: 59% of revenue)**
- Focus: Shopify Plus, BigCommerce Enterprise
- Target client: $10M+ annual revenue brands
- Average deal: $8-12k/month
- Primary acquisition: Lead gen agency, partner referrals

**Marketing (Target: 31% of revenue)**
- Focus: Cross-sell to existing dev clients
- Services: Email (Klaviyo), Paid Social, SEO, CRO
- Average deal: $5-8k/month
- Primary acquisition: Cross-sell, lead gen agency

**Consulting (Target: 8% of revenue)**
- Focus: Strategic advisory, Fractional CTO/CMO
- Use as door-opener for dev/marketing work
- Average deal: $7-12k/month
- Primary acquisition: Existing network, referrals

   - Realistic 2026 (quarterly payments): $7,500/month
   - **Adjustment:** -$15,000/month

2. **Wyze Hours Reduction Risk:**

4. **Poseidon Bikes - Good News:**

**Realistic Starting Point for Q1 2026:**
- Current MRR: $292,946

- **Adjusted baseline: ~$273,746**

- Normal churn: -$13,650
- SiO conversion: +$6,000 (if successful)
- **Baseline after wind-down: ~$221,346**

**This means Q1 needs to add ~$59k to reach $280k end Q1 MRR target**

## 2026 Sales Targets by Service Type

### Annual New Business Required: $209,844

**By Service:**
| Service | New Business | Churn/Loss | Net Growth | End 2026 MRR | % of Total |
|---------|--------------|------------|------------|--------------|------------|
| Development | $110,594 | -$57,844 | $52,750 | $223,541 | 58.5% |
| Marketing | $65,000 | -$31,500 | $33,500 | $117,705 | 30.8% |
| Consulting | $34,250 | -$22,750 | $11,500 | $30,250 | 7.9% |
| Ad-Hoc | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 | 0% |
| **TOTAL** | **$209,844** | **-$112,094** | **$97,750** | **$381,496** | **100%** |

### Client Acquisition Targets

**Total New Clients Needed: 25-28**
- Average deal size: $7,500/month
- Q1: 10-12 clients (aggressive replacement phase)
- Q2-Q4: 15-16 clients (1-2 per month)

**By Service:**
- Development: 12-15 new clients
- Marketing: 8-11 new clients
- Consulting: 4-5 new clients

---

## 2026 Quarterly Targets

### Q1 2026: Critical Replacement Phase - REALISTIC ASSESSMENT

**Context: The Perfect Storm**
- Project revenue ending: -$44,750
- Client revenue reductions (Glenmorangie, Wyze): -$19,200
- Normal quarterly churn: -$13,650
- **Total Q1 headwind: -$77,600**

**Target End Q1 MRR: $280,000**

**Required New Business: $84,000**

**REALITY CHECK - Why Q1 is Extremely Challenging:**

1. **Martal Lead Gen Timeline:**
   - Only 3-6 clients will close in Q1 (not 6-8)
   - Estimated Q1 impact: $22.5-45k MRR
   - Remaining gap to fill: $48-70k

2. **Seasonal Headwinds:**
   - January: Slow buying cycle (post-holiday, budget planning)
   - December: Holiday shutdown affects closing
   - Longer sales cycles in Q1 vs. other quarters

3. **Founder Capacity:**
   - Must also focus on client delivery and retention
   - Sales capacity: realistically 1-2 closes/month from non-Martal sources

**REVISED REALISTIC Q1 TARGET:**

| Metric | Aggressive Target | Realistic Target | Conservative |
|--------|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| New Clients | 10-12 | 7-9 | 5-7 |
| New MRR | $84,000 | $60,000 | $45,000 |
| End Q1 MRR | $280,000 | $260,000 | $245,000 |

**Recommendation: Plan for $260k end Q1 MRR**
- Martal delivers: 4 clients = $30k
- Founder/referrals: 3 clients = $22.5k
- SiO Beauty conversion: 1 client = $6k
- Contract renewals: Save expiring contracts
- **Total new MRR: $58.5k**

This is still ambitious but achievable. Missing the $280k target by $20k is acceptable given the headwinds, and can be made up in Q2 when buying cycles improve.

**By Service (Realistic):**

| Service | New Business | Key Drivers |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Development | $35,000 | Projects ending: -$29,844; Client reductions: -$19,200; Churn: -$8,900; Growth target |

| Consulting | $7,000 | Projects ending: -$18,750; Churn: -$550; Growth target |

**Total Realistic Q1 New Business: $60,000**

**Expected End Q1 MRR: $260,000** (vs. $280k aggressive target)

**New Clients Needed: 7-9** (vs. 10-12 aggressive)

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Martal delivers 4+ closes (67% of expected 3-6)
- SiO Beauty converts to retainer
- Save Q4 2025 expiring contracts (Beach Riot, Glenmorangie, Kindred, Wyze)
- Close 2-3 clients from founder-led/referrals
- Begin building Q2 pipeline now

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Q1 2026 Execution (Make or Break Quarter)

**Why Q1 is Critical:**
- $93k new business needed (3x normal monthly run rate)
- $63k in project revenue ending
- $39k in contracts expiring
- Sets momentum for entire year

**Success Requirements:**
- Lead gen agency delivers 6-8 clients minimum
- Close 100% of Q4 2025 expiring contracts
- Convert 80% of month-to-month to 6-12 month contracts

**If Q1 Fails:**
- Will start Q2 at ~$220-230k MRR (vs. target $248k)
- Need to add extra $20-30k/month in Q2-Q4 to compensate
- May not hit year-end target

### 2. Lead Gen Agency Performance

**Trial Period:** Nov 2025 - Jan 2026
**Investment:** Unknown (add if known)
**Guaranteed Deliverable:** 18 Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs)

**Success Criteria for Renewal:**
| Metric | Minimum | Target | Stretch |
|--------|---------|--------|---------|
| SQLs Delivered | 18 | 20 | 25 |
| Close Rate | 30% | 35% | 40% |
| Clients Closed | 5 | 6-7 | 8+ |
| MRR Added | $37,500 | $45,000 | $60,000 |
| Cost per Client | <$6,000 | <$5,000 | <$4,000 |

**If Agency Succeeds:** Renew and scale
**If Agency Fails:** Need to hire internal sales resource Q2

### 3. Churn Reduction

**Current State:** 35% annual churn (unsustainable)
**Target:** 20% annual churn
**Stretch Goal:** 15% annual churn

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Implement QBR process for all $10k+ clients (monthly for top 10)
- [ ] Create 90-day renewal calendar and outreach workflow
- [ ] Eliminate month-to-month contracts for new clients
- [ ] Build client health scoring system
- [ ] Create early warning system for at-risk accounts
- [ ] Develop win-back program for churned clients

**Financial Impact:**
- Reducing churn from 35% to 20% = ~$39k MRR saved annually
- This would lower new business requirement by $39k

### 4. Month-to-Month Conversion

**Current Month-to-Month Revenue:** $66,840 (24% of MRR)

**Conversion Strategy:**
- Offer 10% discount for 12-month commitment
- Offer 5% discount for 6-month commitment
- Enhanced service package for longer commitments
- Grandfather current pricing (for now)

**Target Conversion Rate:** 80% (save $53k of the $67k)

**Timeline:** Complete by end of January 2026

## Assumptions & Notes

### Key Assumptions in This Forecast

1. **Churn Rate:** Assuming 20% annual churn (improvement from current 35%)
   - If churn stays at 35%, need additional $39k in new business

2. **Lead Gen Agency:** Assuming 35% close rate on 18 SQLs = 6-7 clients
   - If close rate is lower, Q1 target at risk

3. **Average Deal Size:** $7,500/month
   - Range: $5,000 - $15,000 depending on service mix

4. **Contract Terms:** Shifting to 6-12 month minimums for new clients
   - Current mix includes many month-to-month

5. **Service Mix:** Maintaining roughly 60/30/10 split (Dev/Marketing/Consulting)
   - May shift based on market demand

6. **Economic Conditions:** Stable to improving throughout 2026
   - Tariff impacts not modeled
   - eCommerce market remains strong

7. **Team Capacity:** Assuming ability to service growth without major hiring
   - May need to add 2-3 resources if hitting targets

8. **Satechi:** Project ends Feb 2026, retainer starts April 2026 (Q2)
   - 2-month gap with no revenue
   - Retainer: $6,250/month for 12 months

9. **MadEngine:** Projects end January 2026, will NOT convert to retainer
   - Need to replace full $30k in Q1

### Items to Update/Validate

- [ ] Lead gen agency cost and contract terms
- [ ] Confirm Satechi retainer start date (currently assumed April)
- [ ] Validate Q4 2025 expiring contract renewal likelihood
- [ ] Historical annual revenue for 2023-2024 (to confirm decline trend)
