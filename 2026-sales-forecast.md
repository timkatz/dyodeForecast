### 4. Key Client Updates & Revenue Risks

#### High-Value Client Risks:

**Glenmorangie ($22,500 current MRR) - SIGNIFICANT RISK**
- **Payment Model:** 150-hour buckets at $150/hr ($22,500 per payment)
- **2025 Pattern:** Paid 7 times (Jan, Mar, Apr, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep), Q3 paid monthly ($22,500/month)
- **Historical:** Typically pays quarterly (~$22,500/quarter)
- **Recent Trend:** Slowed significantly in Oct/Nov - engagement declining
- **2026 Forecast:** Conservative quarterly model = $7,500/month average
- **Potential Impact:** -$15,000/month if reverting to normal quarterly cadence
- **Action:** Proactive engagement to understand needs, propose retainer model

**Wyze ($16,800 current MRR) - MODERATE RISK**
- **Current:** 140 hours/month at $120/hr (Q3-Q4 2025 increase from 70 hours)
- **Risk:** Client mentioned wanting to hire in-house Shopify developer
- **Potential Impact:** Could drop to $8,400/month (original 70 hours) or less in Q1
- **Conservative Forecast:** Assume drop to $12,600/month (105 hours) in Q1 2026
- **Potential Loss:** -$4,200/month
- **Action:** Demonstrate unique value, propose strategic work beyond dev hours

**SiO Beauty ($4,500 current project) - OPPORTUNITY**
- **Current:** Black Friday theme rush project (ending 11/30/25)
- **Opportunity:** Client interested in Q1 2026 continuation
  - Option A: Custom theme build (no rush) - likely $15-25k project
  - Option B: Ongoing retainer - target $5-8k/month
- **Preferred Path:** Convert to retainer for stable MRR (like Satechi model)
- **Action:** Proposal ready before project delivery in late November

**Updated Revenue Risk Assessment:**
- Glenmorangie normalization: -$15,000/month (likely)
- Wyze reduction: -$4,200/month (possible)
- SiO Beauty opportunity: +$5-8k/month (if converted)
- **Net Q1 Impact:** -$13k to -$19k/month potential headwind

---

**Lost Client Revenue Impact:**
- Retainer MRR lost: ~$114.5k annually (Development $25.1k + Marketing $65.4k + Consulting $24k from losses + Great Star Tools/Tipsy Elves reductions)
- Project revenue lost: ~$224.5k (one-time)
- **Total revenue impact: ~$339k in potential annual revenue**

**Key Insight:**
- Only 1 of 24 service losses (4%) was from a multi-service client who stayed
- **Multi-service clients are stickier** - Tipsy Elves proves the value
- Losing single-service clients = losing entire relationship (96% of losses)

#### 2025 Churn Rate Analysis

**CORRECTED: Unique Client Churn vs. Service Churn**

**Overall Unique Client Churn:**
- **Starting unique clients:** ~50-52 (estimated Jan 2025)
- **Unique clients added:** 13
- **Unique clients lost:** 20 (Tipsy Elves retained as multi-service)
- **Net unique client change:** -7 clients
- **Ending unique clients:** 30 (as of November 2025)
- **Unique client churn rate:** ~38-40% (industry benchmark: 15-20%)

---

**Service-Level Churn (More Granular):**

**Development Service Churn:**
- Starting service engagements: ~25
- Added: 10 service engagements
- Lost: 11 service engagements (all = complete client loss)
- **Net change: -1**
- **Service churn rate: ~44%** (extremely high)
- **Client retention when lost: 0%** (no dev clients retained via other services)

**Marketing Service Churn:**
- Starting service engagements: ~18
- Added: 6 service engagements
- Lost: 10 service engagements (all = complete client loss)
- **Net change: -4**
- **Service churn rate: ~56%** (critical)
- **Client retention when lost: 0%** (no marketing clients retained via other services)

**Consulting Service Churn:**
- Starting service engagements: ~5
- Added: 3 service engagements (includes 2 to existing clients: MadEngine, Tipsy Elves)
- Lost: 4 service engagements
  - 3 complete client losses (3HNails, Cavaco, Zgallerie)
  - **1 service loss, client retained (Tipsy Elves kept Development)** ✅
- **Net change: -1**
- **Service churn rate: ~80%** (unsustainable)
- **Client retention when lost: 25%** (Tipsy Elves stayed)

---

**Key Findings:**

1. **95% of service losses = complete client loss** (27 of 28 service engagements lost)
2. **Only 1 multi-service client (Tipsy Elves) retained after losing a service**
3. **This proves multi-service client value** - they're stickier (25% retained vs. 0% single-service)
4. **Single-service clients are at extreme risk** - when they leave one service, they leave entirely

---

#### Multi-Service Client Tracking (Nov 2025)

**Current Multi-Service Clients:** 4 unique clients with multiple service engagements

| Client | Services | Status | MRR | Notes |
|--------|----------|--------|-----|-------|
| **AG Jeans** | Dev + Marketing | ✅ Active (both) | $24,000 | Strong relationship, 2 services |
| **Great Star Tools** | Dev (2x) + Marketing | ✅ Active (all 3) | $16,000 | Largest multi-service client, 3 engagements |
| **MadEngine (Fithsun)** | Marketing + Consulting | ✅ Active (both) | $90,000 | Projects ending Jan 2026, will NOT convert |
| **Tipsy Elves** | Dev + Consulting | ⚠️ Partial (Dev only) | $7,500 | Lost Consulting 10/31/25, retained Dev |

**Multi-Service Client Performance:**
- **Total:** 4 unique clients (13% of 30 active clients)
- **Service engagements:** 9 total (from these 4 clients)
- **2025 retention when service lost:** 1 of 1 (Tipsy Elves - 100%)
- **Average MRR per multi-service client:** $34,375
- **Average MRR per single-service client:** $9,483
- **Multi-service clients are 3.6x higher value**

**Historical Context (2025):**
- **Added 2 new multi-service relationships:** MadEngine (Marketing + Consulting), Tipsy Elves (Dev + Consulting)
- **Lost 0 multi-service clients completely** (0% complete loss rate)
- **Lost 1 service from multi-service client:** Tipsy Elves Consulting (but client retained via Dev)
- **Retention rate for multi-service clients:** 100% (4 of 4 still active in some capacity)

**Comparison to Single-Service Clients:**
- **Single-service clients lost completely:** 21 of ~46 (46% churn rate)
- **Multi-service clients lost completely:** 0 of 4 (0% churn rate)
- **Multi-service clients are dramatically stickier** - evidence for cross-sell strategy

---

#### Root Causes of High Churn:
1. **High project dependency** (26% of revenue - projects naturally end)
2. **Too many month-to-month contracts** (24% of MRR - no commitment)
3. **Economic headwinds** (inflation, tariffs impacting eCommerce clients)
4. **Lack of systematic lead generation** (tried cold email, founder-led, Google Ads March 2025—closed 4 clients but couldn't sustain; Meta/LinkedIn Ads attempted but creative direction challenges prevented launch; relied primarily on organic/inbound and referrals)
5. **Insufficient retention processes** (no formal QBRs, renewal outreach)
6. **Quality of client fit** (some clients may not be ideal long-term fits)

#### Impact on 2026 Strategy:

This churn analysis directly informs our 2026 priorities:

1. **Reduce churn from 35% to 20%** through better retention processes
2. **Shift from month-to-month to minimum 6-month terms** for all new clients
3. **Build systematic sales pipeline** (Martal lead gen launched 11/1/25)
4. **Improve client quality** through better qualification
5. **Convert projects to retainers** (like Satechi model)
6. **Target 25-30 new clients** to offset expected churn and grow

### 6. Revenue Decline Trend

**Historical Revenue (Accrual Basis):**
| Year | Revenue | YoY Change | % Change | Profit Margin |
|------|---------|------------|----------|---------------|
| 2018 | $1,659,720 | - | - | 58.9%* |
| 2019 | $1,752,305 | +$92,585 | +5.6% | 63.4%* |
| 2020 | $2,827,321 | +$1,075,016 | +61.3% (Pandemic boom) | 53.5%** |
| 2021 | $3,763,785 | +$936,464 | +33.1% | 6.9% |
| 2022 | $4,882,926 | +$1,119,141 | +29.7% (Peak) | 8.5% |
| 2023 | $4,855,203 | -$27,723 | -0.6% | 10.8% |
| 2024 | $3,866,040 | -$989,163 | -20.4% | 5.6% |
| 2025 (est) | $3,615,000 | -$251,040 | -6.5% | 6.0% |

*2018-2019 margins not comparable (did not include co-founder salaries in accounting)
**2020 first year with proper accounting including co-founder salaries

**Cash vs. Accrual Note:**
- 2025 accrual income: $3.01M (10 months YTD), projected ~$3.6M full year
- 2025 cash income: $2.85M (10 months YTD), ~$165k lower due to outstanding AR
- Gap primarily from 2 distressed clients: Movano ($46k) + The Bruery ($66k) with equity/relationship complexity
- Remaining ~$53k is normal AR timing

**Key Insights:**
- **Peak Revenue:** $4.88M in 2022
- **Current Trajectory:** Down 26% from peak over 3 years (-$1.27M)
- **2022-2023:** Modest decline (-0.6%) - manageable
- **2023-2024:** Accelerated decline (-20%) - concerning
- **2024-2025:** Improvement (-6.5%) - still declining but slowing
- **Profit margin improving:** 5.6% (2024) → 6.0% (2025 projected)
- **Urgency:** Must reverse trend in 2026 to avoid further erosion and return toward $4M+ levels

## 2026 Strategic Plan

### Overall Goal: Reverse Decline & Return to Growth

**2026 MRR Baseline Components:**
| Component | Monthly | Notes |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| Core Retainers (Jan 2026) | ~$223k | After GST renewal reduction |
| Partner Referral Commission | $8.5k | Baseline partnership revenue |
| Ad-Hoc Dev Hours (Overages) | $7.5k | Client overage hours above minimums |
| **Total January 2026 Baseline** | **$238.5k** | Recurring monthly revenue |

**Target End 2026 MRR:** $381,496

| Revenue Growth | +$1.0M | 32% |

### Strategic Priorities

#### 1. CRITICAL: Maintain Shopify Plus Partner Status (Premier or Platinum)

**Current Status:** ⚠️ **AT RISK** - Only 1 Shopify Plus MIGRATION in past 2 years (BuildDirect 2023)

---

### Complete Shopify Partner Tier Structure

| Tier | Merchant Revenue | Referrals Required | People/Skills | Partner Benefits |
|------|------------------|-------------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Select** | $100k-$500k | 1 Plus or 10 Standard (5yr) | 1/3 | Basic partner badge |
| **Plus** | $500k-$2.5M | 2 Plus or 40 Standard (5yr) | 3/10 | Enhanced support |
| **Premier** | $2M-$10M | **4 Plus or 40 Standard (2yr)** | 10/30 | Priority support, co-marketing |
| **Platinum** | $5M-$25M | **6 Plus (2yr)** | 25/80 | Dedicated partner manager, top-tier benefits |

**Requirements Explained:**
- **Merchant Revenue:** Total GMV/revenue from merchants DYODE refers to Shopify
- **Referrals Required:** New merchant referrals to Shopify Plus or Standard (within timeframe)
- **People/Skills:** Staff count / Staff with Shopify certifications

---

### DYODE Current Assessment Against Tier Criteria

#### Criterion 1: Merchant Revenue (Total GMV from DYODE Shopify clients)

**Current Shopify/Plus Client Base:**
- 61% of MRR = ~$178k/month from Shopify/Plus merchants
- ~15-20 Shopify Plus clients
- Estimated client GMV range: $10M-$75M per merchant
- **Total estimated merchant revenue: $200M-$1B+**

**Assessment:** ✅ **EXCEEDS Platinum threshold** ($5M-$25M+)
**Status:** Not a constraint

---

#### Criterion 2: Referrals (Plus migrations or Standard referrals)

**For Premier Tier:** 4 Plus or 40 Standard (2yr)
**For Platinum Tier:** 6 Plus (2yr)

**CRITICAL CLARIFICATION - What Counts as "Referral":**
- ✅ **COUNTS:** Platform migrations TO Shopify Plus (from BigCommerce, Magento, WooCommerce, custom, etc.)
- ✅ **COUNTS:** New merchants signing up for Shopify Plus through DYODE
- ❌ **DOES NOT COUNT:** Existing Shopify/Plus merchants (redesigns, retainers, ongoing work)
- ❌ **DOES NOT COUNT:** Shopify → Shopify Plus upgrades (likely, confirm with Shopify)
- ✅ **ANY SIZE QUALIFIES:** No minimum project value (typically $50k-$300k, avg ~$75k)

**Recent 2-Year Performance (2024-2025):**
- 2024: 0 Plus referrals ❌
- 2025: 0 Plus referrals ❌
- **Total 2-year: 1 Plus referral (BuildDirect in 2023, rolling off soon)**

**Assessment:** ⚠️ **CRITICAL RISK - Only 1 Plus referral in 2-year window**
- **Premier tier (4 Plus):** Need 3+ additional referrals in 2026 to maintain
- **Platinum tier (6 Plus):** Need 5+ additional referrals in 2026 to maintain
**Status:** **PRIMARY CONSTRAINT AND URGENT PRIORITY**

---

#### Criterion 3: People/Skills (Staff count / Shopify certified staff)

**Current DYODE Team Assessment:**

| Role | Count | Shopify Certifications | Notes |
|------|-------|----------------------|-------|
| Co-Founders | 2 | 0 | Tim Katz & George |
| Director of Web Development | 1 | 1-2 (est) | Kevin - oversees Shopify dev team |
| Project Managers (Dev) | ~3-4 | 1-2 | Elana, Biddle, Jason, Cyndi |
| Web Developers | ~6-8 | 6+ | Kevin, Alyssa, Paul, Cris, Eric, Anthony |
| Director of Digital Marketing | 1 | 0-1 | Lucas (Marketing Fundamentals assigned) |
| Marketing Team | 2 | 0 | Bruce, Jessica (courses assigned) |
| Sales/Operations | 1 | 0-1 | Brandon (Selling Fundamentals assigned) |
| **TOTAL STAFF** | **~15-18** | **12 completed + 16 in-progress** | Small, lean team |

**Certification Breakdown:**
- ✅ **Completed:** 12 certifications
  - Development Fundamentals: 6
  - Liquid Storefronts: 3
  - Selling Fundamentals: 1
  - Positioning courses: 2
- ⚠️ **In Progress:** 16 certifications assigned, not completed
- 📊 **Total Potential:** 28 certifications (if all in-progress completed)

**For Premier Tier:** 10 people / 30 Shopify skills (certifications)
**For Platinum Tier:** 25 people / 80 Shopify skills (certifications)

**Assessment:** ⚠️ **ACHIEVABLE for Premier, DOES NOT MEET Platinum**
- Staff count: 15-18 ✅ (meets Premier 10+, below Platinum 25+)
- Shopify certifications: 12 completed, 28 potential ⚠️ (close to Premier 30, need 2-4 more)
**Status:** **ACHIEVABLE CONSTRAINT - Need to complete in-progress certifications + 2-4 more**

---

### 2026 Partner Tier Strategy & Recommendation

**Realistic Target: Premier Tier**

| Criterion | Premier Requirement | Current Status | Gap to Close | Achievability |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|--------------|---------------|
| Merchant Revenue | $2M-$10M | $200M-$1B+ (est) | ✅ Exceeds | ✅ No action needed |
| Plus Referrals | 4 (2yr) | 1 | Need 3+ in 2026 | ⚠️ Challenging but achievable |
| People/Skills | 10/30 | 15-18 / 12 completed + 16 in-progress | Need 2-4 more certifications | ✅ Achievable - just complete in-progress |

**Stretch Target: Platinum Tier**

| Criterion | Platinum Requirement | Current Status | Gap to Close | Achievability |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------|--------------|---------------|
| Merchant Revenue | $5M-$25M+ | $200M-$1B+ (est) | ✅ Exceeds | ✅ No action needed |
| Plus Referrals | 6 (2yr) | 1 | Need 5+ in 2026 | ❌ Very difficult (5x increase) |
| People/Skills | 25/80 | 15-18 / 28 potential | 7-10 more staff, 52+ certs | ❌ Not feasible in 2026 |

**RECOMMENDATION: Focus on Premier Tier (4 Plus referrals in 2026)**
- More achievable than Platinum given current team size
- Still provides strong partner benefits (priority support, co-marketing)
- Sets foundation for Platinum in 2027-2028 if team scales

**Why Premier/Platinum Matters:**
- 61% of current MRR comes from Shopify/Plus merchants ($178k/month)
- Partner badge drives inbound leads and credibility
- Access to Shopify partner referrals and co-marketing
- Competitive advantage in sales process
- **Without Premier+ status:** Lose competitive edge, inbound flow, and co-marketing opportunities

---

### Shopify Plus MIGRATION Targets for 2026

**Historical Performance:**
- 2020: 2 migrations (Pali Wine, Brandless)
- 2021: 3 migrations (Invisalign, Steals, Belly Bandit)
- 2023: 1 migration (BuildDirect)
- 2024: 0 migrations ❌
- 2025: 0 migrations ❌
- **2-Year Rolling (2024-2025):** Only 1 migration (BuildDirect in 2023, rolling off)

**⚠️ Reality Check:** Need to close 4 migrations in 2026 for Premier tier = **4x increase from recent performance**

**2026 Annual Target: 4 Plus Migrations (Premier Tier) to 6 (Stretch to Platinum)**

| Tier Goal | Migration Target | Project Value | Staffing Constraint | Achievability |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Premier (BASE)** | 4 migrations | $300k | 10/30 (meets threshold) | ⚠️ Challenging but achievable |
| **Platinum (STRETCH)** | 6 migrations | $450k | 25/80 (does not meet) | ❌ Not feasible in 2026 |

**RECOMMENDATION: Target Premier Tier (4 migrations)**

| Quarter | Migration Target | Project Value | Cumulative | Status | Critical Deadline |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Q1 2026** | 1 migration | $75k | 1 | Foundation | March 31, 2026 |
| **Q2 2026** | 2 migrations | $150k | 3 | On Track | June 30, 2026 |
| **Q3 2026** | 1 migration | $75k | 4 | ✅ Premier Achieved | Sept 30, 2026 |
| **Q4 2026** | 0-2 migrations | $0-150k | 4-6 | Stretch to Platinum | Dec 31, 2026 |
| **TOTAL (BASE)** | **4 migrations** | **$300k** | **4** | **🎯 Premier Tier** | **Annual Review** |
| **TOTAL (STRETCH)** | **6 migrations** | **$450k** | **6** | **⭐ Platinum (if staffing met)** | **Annual Review** |

**Key Milestones:**
- ✅ **March 31, 2026:** Must have 1 migration closed (Foundation)
- ✅ **June 30, 2026:** Must have 3 migrations closed (75% to Premier goal)
- ✅ **Sept 30, 2026:** Must have 4 migrations closed (🎯 Premier tier achieved)
- ⭐ **Dec 31, 2026:** 6 migrations = Stretch to Platinum (if team scales and gets certifications)

**Current Q1 2026 Migration Pipeline:**

| Opportunity | Platform | Revenue Size | Timeline | Status | Confidence |
|-------------|----------|--------------|----------|--------|------------|
| **Jerome's Furniture** | Migration to Plus | ~$75k (est) | Q1 2026 start | On hold (tariffs) | 🟡 Medium |
| **Bolle Brands** | Migration to Plus (4 brands) | ~$100-150k (est) | Q2 2026 start | Low communication | 🟡 Medium |

**Pipeline Gap Analysis:**
- **Current pipeline:** 2 opportunities
- **Target for year:** 4-6 migrations needed
- **Gap:** 2-4 additional migration opportunities required
- **Source to fill gap:** Martal lead gen + founder-led outreach + Shopify partner referrals

**⚠️ URGENT:** Pipeline is insufficient. Need Martal to deliver 10-12 migration SQLs to hit 4-6 closes.

---

#### Migration Revenue Timing vs Recognition

**Important:** Migration projects typically span 3-6 months, so revenue recognition differs from close timing.

**Project Timeline (Typical):**
- **Month 0:** Deal closed, SOW signed
- **Month 0-1:** Discovery & planning (25% payment) = $18.75k
- **Month 1-3:** Development & build (50% payment) = $37.5k
- **Month 3-4:** Testing & QA (15% payment) = $11.25k
- **Month 4-6:** Launch & post-launch support (10% payment) = $7.5k

**Revenue Recognition by Quarter (Based on 4 migration base case):**

| Quarter | Deals Closed | Project Start Timing | 2026 Revenue Recognized | Remaining to 2027 |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|
| **Q1** | 1 ($75k) | Jan-Mar starts | $56.25k (75%) | $18.75k (25%) |
| **Q2** | 2 ($150k) | Apr-Jun starts | $112.5k (75%) | $37.5k (25%) |
| **Q3** | 1 ($75k) | Jul-Sep starts | $56.25k (75%) | $18.75k (25%) |
| **Q4** | 0 ($0k) | No new starts | $0k | $0k |
| **TOTAL** | **4 ($300k)** | **Jan-Sep 2026** | **$225k (75%)** | **$75k (25%)** |

**Note:** ~$75k of migration project revenue will spill into Q1 2027 for projects starting Q3 2026.

**2026 Total Migration Revenue (Accrual Basis):** $225k recognized in 2026, $75k in 2027

---

#### Pipeline Sources & Requirements to Hit Target

**To close 4 migrations in 2026, we need:**

| Source | SQLs/Opps Required | Close Rate | Expected Closes | Revenue Contribution |
|--------|-------------------|------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Current Pipeline** | 2 (Jerome's, Bolle) | 50% | 1 | $75-125k |
| **Martal Lead Gen** | 10-12 | 35% | 3-4 | $225-300k |
| **Founder Outreach** | 3-4 | 30% | 1 | $75k |
| **Shopify Referrals** | 2-3 | 25% | 0-1 | $0-75k |
| **TOTAL REQUIRED** | **17-21 migration opps** | **~35% avg** | **5-7 closes** | **$375-575k** |

**Critical Success Factors:**
1. **Martal delivers 10-12 migration SQLs** (not just general Shopify Plus SQLs)
2. **Close rate of 35%+** on migration opportunities (higher than typical 30%)
3. **Re-engage Jerome's and Bolle** in Q1 before pipeline dries up
4. **Founder dedicates time** to high-value migration opportunities

---

#### Integration with Overall 2026 Revenue Target

**2026 Overall Target:** $4.2M total revenue

**Migration Project Revenue Contribution:**
- Migration projects recognized in 2026: $225k (from 4 closes)
- Migration projects billed in 2026: $300k (full project value)
- % of 2026 revenue target: 5.4% (recognized) or 7.1% (billed)

**Post-Migration Retainer Opportunity:**
- Historical conversion: ~60% of migrations convert to ongoing retainers
- Expected conversions: 2-3 post-migration retainers
- Retainer value: $6-10k/month avg
- Q4 2026 MRR impact: $12-30k (from migrations closed Q1-Q2)
- 2027 annual value: $144-360k

**Total Migration Program Value (2026-2027):**
- 2026 project revenue: $300k
- 2027 project spillover: $75k
- 2027 retainer MRR: $144-360k/year
- **Total 2-year value: $519-735k from 4 migration closes**

**Why Migrations are Strategic Priority:**
1. Partner status preservation (competitive advantage)
2. Large upfront project revenue ($75k avg)
3. High retainer conversion rate (60%)
4. Long-term client relationships (multi-year)
5. Portfolio credibility for future migration sales

---

**Platform Migration Targeting (Priority Order):**

1. **BigCommerce Enterprise** → Shopify Plus
   - Pain points: Limited app ecosystem, slower innovation, similar pricing
   - Easiest conversion path

2. **Magento/Adobe Commerce** → Shopify Plus
   - Pain points: High hosting costs, complexity, expensive maintenance
   - Strong ROI case for migration

3. **WooCommerce (at scale)** → Shopify Plus
   - Pain points: Performance issues at $10M+, plugin conflicts, security
   - Brands outgrowing WordPress

4. **Custom/Legacy Platforms** → Shopify Plus
   - Pain points: Technical debt, hard to maintain, expensive devs
   - Modernization play

**Avoid Targeting:**
- ❌ Existing Shopify merchants (don't count for partner status)
- ❌ Existing Shopify Plus merchants (don't count for partner status)

---

**Martal Lead Gen: Migration-Specific Requirements**

**Pilot Phase (Nov 2025 - Jan 2026):**
- **Total SQLs guaranteed:** 18
- **Migration SQLs required:** 3-4 (highest priority)
- **Expected closes:** 1-2 migrations in Q1

**If Extended (Q2-Q4 2026):**
- **Additional SQLs:** ~60-70
- **Migration SQLs required:** 8-10 (15% of total)
- **Expected closes:** 3-4 migrations

**Total 2026 from Martal:** 10-12 migration SQLs → 4-6 closes (at 30-35% close rate)

**Migration SQL Qualification Criteria:**
1. ✅ Currently on **non-Shopify platform** (BigCommerce, Magento, WooCommerce, custom)
2. ✅ $10M+ annual revenue (Shopify Plus qualified)
3. ✅ Ready to evaluate migration in next 90 days
4. ✅ Migration budget allocated or planned
5. ✅ Decision maker engaged (CMO, VP eCommerce, Founder)

**Success Metric for Martal:**
- **PRIMARY:** Migration SQLs delivered (this is the #1 priority, worth 2-3x a regular SQL)
- **Secondary:** General Shopify Plus SQLs for revenue growth

### Action Required: Address Shopify Certification Gap for Premier Tier

**Current Constraint:** Below Premier requirement of 30 Shopify certifications

**Current State (Verified):**
- Total staff: 15-18 people ✅ (meets Premier 10+)
- Shopify certifications completed: **12** ⚠️ (below Premier 30)
  - Development Fundamentals: 6 (Kevin, Alyssa, Paul, Cris, Eric, Anthony)
  - Liquid Storefronts: 3 (Kevin, Alyssa, Paul)
  - Selling Fundamentals: 1 (from Elana, Biddle, Jason, Cyndi, Brandon)
  - Positioning International Selling: 1
  - Positioning Checkout Value: 1
- **Certifications in progress:** 16 (assigned but not completed)
- **Gap: 18 additional certifications needed to reach 30**

**2026 Certification Strategy:**

**Step 1: Complete In-Progress Certifications (16 assigned, not completed)**

| Course | Assigned To | Completed | Remaining | Priority |
|--------|-------------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Liquid Storefronts | 8 assigned | 3 ✅ | 5 to complete | **HIGH** - Dev team |
| Selling Fundamentals | 5 assigned | 1 ✅ | 4 to complete | **HIGH** - Sales/PM team |
| Solution Planning Fundamentals | Elana | 0 | 1 to complete | **MEDIUM** - PM |
| Marketing Fundamentals | Lucas, Bruce, Jessica | 0 | 3 to complete | **MEDIUM** - Marketing |
| Selling/Positioning Shopify Marketing | 2 marketing | 0 | 2 to complete | **MEDIUM** - Marketing |
| Positioning Checkout Value | 2 PM team | 1 ✅ | 1 to complete | **LOW** - Nice to have |

**Total In-Progress to Complete:** 16 certifications

**Step 2: Additional Certifications Needed (To reach 30 total)**

Current: 12 completed
+ In-Progress: 16 → Would reach 28 total
**Additional needed: 2-4 certifications to reach 30**

| Priority | Team | Additional Certifications | Timeline | Count |
|----------|------|---------------------------|----------|-------|
| **MEDIUM** | Co-Founders (2) | Shopify Plus Merchant | Q2 2026 | 2 |
| **LOW** | Directors (3) | Shopify Product Fundamentals (if not already covered) | Q2 2026 | 2-3 |

**Total Path to 30:**
- Current completed: 12 ✅
- Complete in-progress: 16 → **28 total**
- Additional 2-4 certifications → **30-32 total** ✅ **Premier threshold met**

**Implementation Plan:**

**Q1 2026 (Jan-Mar) - Complete In-Progress Certifications:**
- [ ] **Week 1-2:** Push to complete 16 in-progress certifications
  - Priority 1: 5 remaining Liquid Storefronts (dev team)
  - Priority 2: 4 remaining Selling Fundamentals (sales/PM team)
  - Priority 3: 7 marketing and planning certifications
- [ ] **Week 3-4:** Review progress, identify blockers
- [ ] Allocate 4-6 hours/person to complete already-assigned courses
- [ ] **Target: 22-25 total certifications by end Q1** (12 current + 10-13 from in-progress)

**Q2 2026 (Apr-Jun) - Final Push to 30:**
- [ ] Complete remaining in-progress certifications (3-6 remaining)
- [ ] Co-founders complete Shopify Plus Merchant certification (2 certs)
- [ ] Directors complete any missing certifications (2-3 certs)
- [ ] **Target: 30+ total certifications by June 30** ✅ (meet Premier threshold)
- [ ] Submit certification proof to Shopify for Premier tier review

**Q3-Q4 2026 (Jul-Dec) - Maintenance & Growth:**
- [ ] New hires obtain certifications within 90 days
- [ ] Existing staff pursue advanced certifications
- [ ] Target: 35-40 certifications by end of year

**Revised Cost & Time Investment:**
- **Cost:** $0 (Shopify certifications are free for partners)
- **Time per certification:** 4-6 hours (courses already assigned, just need completion)
- **Total time investment:** ~64-96 hours across team in Q1-Q2 (much lower than original estimate)
- **ROI:** Partner status preservation = competitive advantage + inbound leads

**Why This is Achievable:**
- ✅ Already have 12 certifications completed (40% to goal)
- ✅ 16 certifications already assigned to team members (just need completion)
- ✅ Only need 2-4 additional certifications beyond in-progress ones
- ⚠️ Must complete in-progress certifications by Q2 to meet Premier tier requirements

**Why This Matters:**
- Premier tier requires 10 people / 30 Shopify skills
- Current: 15-18 people ✅ / 12 skills completed ⚠️ / 16 in-progress ⚠️
- **Without 30 certifications, at risk of losing Premier tier even if hit 4 Plus referrals**
- Certifications are free, just require time investment (team already has access)
- Must complete before Shopify annual partner review

---

#### 2. NEW: Cross-Sell Strategy & Account Manager Incentive Program

**Current Opportunity:**
- **27 of 30 active clients (90%)** only use ONE service
- **~20-21 truly viable cross-sell targets** after excluding:
  - Past service history (Wyze, Tori Richard, Stikwood)
  - Failed cross-sell attempts (United Scope dev)
  - Frozen budgets (Pair of Thieves)
  - Enterprise complexity (Glenmorangie - challenging)
- Only 3 clients currently have multiple services
- Multi-service clients have 50-70% higher retention rates
- Cross-sells are 5-10x easier to close than new client acquisition

**Breakdown:**
- 17-18 viable Development-only clients → Cross-sell Marketing or Consulting
- 3 viable Marketing-only clients → Cross-sell Development or Consulting
- 1 Consulting-only client → Cross-sell Development or Marketing

**2026 Cross-Sell Targets (Revised Down):**
- **Goal:** 6-8 cross-sells (down from 8-10)
- **Revenue Impact:** $40,000 - $58,000 new MRR (reality-adjusted)
- **Contribution:** 19-24% of total new business in 2026

**Account Manager Incentive Program:**
- **Commission:** 5% of contract term value (one-time payment)
- **Example:** $7,500/month x 6-month contract = $2,250 commission
- **Aligns with typical 3-6 month contract terms** (not full year)
- **Encourages longer contracts:** 6-month term = higher commission than 3-month
- **Annual Budget:** $10,000 - $16,000 (adjusted)
- **ROI:** 30-45x return on investment
- **Strategic Value:** Performance-based compensation during salary freeze period

**Key Benefits:**
1. Lower CAC: ~$2,500 vs ~$5,000+ for new clients
2. Faster sales cycle: 2-3 weeks vs 4-8 weeks
3. Higher retention: Multi-service clients churn at 15% vs 35%
4. Team motivation: Alternative to raises that drives revenue

**Top Priority Targets (Revised):**
- Cookware Co ($10.5k Dev) → Marketing $5-8k/month
- Align Tech ($8.6k Dev) → Marketing $5-7k/month
- DITA ($7.5k Dev) → Marketing $5-8k/month
- Poseidon Bikes ($8.6k Marketing) → Development $6-10k/month
- Bandai Namco ($7.7k Marketing) → Development $6-10k/month

**Removed from Priority List:**
- ❌ United Scope - Failed dev cross-sell attempt, has in-house dev
- ⏸️ Pair of Thieves - Budgets frozen, ad-hoc dev already
- ⚠️ Glenmorangie - LVMH-owned, enterprise barriers (still worth trying)

**Detailed Strategy:** See cross-sell-strategy-2026.md and past-service-history.md

---

#### 3. NEW: Client Referral & Review Incentive Program

**Why This Matters:**
- **Referrals have 60-80% close rate** vs. 25-35% for other channels
- **Referral CAC: $500-2,000** vs. $5,000+ for Martal-sourced leads
- **Clutch reviews drive 30-40%** of inbound agency leads
- **Social proof critical** for closing Shopify Plus clients

**Program Structure:**
- **Clutch Review Incentive:** $500 service credit per qualified review
- **Referral Incentive:** 5-10% of first contract value in service credits
- Credit-based system (applies to future invoices, never cash)

**2026 Goals:**
- **Reviews:** 10-15 new Clutch reviews
- **Referrals:** 5-8 client referrals converting to signed contracts
- **Revenue Impact:** $250,000 - $400,000 from referrals
- **Investment:** $25,000 - $42,500 in service credits
- **ROI:** 10-15x return on investment

**Referral Tiers:**
- $15k-30k contract: 5% credit
- $30k-50k contract: 7% credit
- $50k-75k contract: 8% credit
- $75k+ contract: 10% credit

**Impact on Client Acquisition:**
- Referrals will contribute **5-8 clients (20-30%)** of new client target
- Reduces dependence on Martal (from 40% to 35%)
- Higher quality leads (better fit, faster close, lower CAC)

**Launch Timeline:**
- January 2026: Soft launch with top 10 clients
- February 2026: Full launch to all active clients
- Quarterly reminder campaigns throughout 2026

**Detailed Program:** See client-referral-review-program.md

---

#### 4. Stabilize Revenue Base (Q1 2026 - Critical)
- **Convert month-to-month to contracts** ($67k at risk)
- **Save Q4 2025 expiring contracts** ($39k at risk)
- **Replace project revenue** ($63k ending)
- **Target:** Minimize churn, secure base

#### 5. Build Systematic Sales Engine

**Lead Gen Agency (Martal) - Launched 11/1/25:**

**Contract Terms:**
  - 3-month pilot: Nov 2025 - Jan 2026
  - Guaranteed: 18 Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs)

**REALISTIC Timeline & Expectations:**

Month 1 (November 2025):
- Agency setup, list building, initial outreach
- First SQLs delivered late November
- **Expected:** 2-4 SQLs, 0-1 closes

Month 2 (December 2025):
- Continued SQL delivery
- November SQLs in sales process
- Holiday slowdown affects close rates
- **Expected:** 6-8 SQLs, 1-2 closes

Month 3 (January 2026):
- Final SQL delivery (complete 18 guarantee)
- December SQLs in sales process
- Some November SQLs closing
- **Expected:** 8-10 SQLs, 2-3 closes

Post-Pilot (Feb-March 2026):
- Closing lag: January SQLs close in Feb-Mar
- **Expected:** 2-4 additional closes

**Realistic Martal Impact:**
- **Q1 Closes:** 3-6 clients (not 6-8)
- **Q2 Closes:** 2-4 clients (lag effect)
- **Total from 18 SQLs:** 5-10 clients over 6 months
- **Effective Close Rate:** 28-56% (over time, not immediately)
- **Q1 MRR from Martal:** $22.5k - $45k (lower than originally estimated)

**Key Reality Check:**
- SQLs delivered ≠ immediate closes
- Average sales cycle: 30-60 days
- Holiday season (Dec) slows decision-making
- Q1 budget conversations delay January closes
- Must supplement with other lead sources

---

**eCommerce Agency Buying Seasonality:**

Understanding when brands invest in agency services:

**Q1 (Jan-Mar) - SLOW START:**
- January: Budgets approved but slow decision-making, post-holiday recovery
- February: Activity picks up, planning mode
- March: Stronger, preparing for Q2 initiatives
- **Typical Pattern:** Longer sales cycles, more conservative

**Q2 (Apr-Jun) - STRONG:**
- Fresh annual budgets being deployed
- Mid-year planning and optimization
- Pre-summer sales preparation
- **Typical Pattern:** Faster decisions, higher close rates

**Q3 (Jul-Sep) - MODERATE:**
- July-August: Summer slowdown, vacations
- September: Ramp up for holiday season
- **Typical Pattern:** Mixed - slow then accelerates

**Q4 (Oct-Dec) - MIXED:**
- October-November: Budget flush (use it or lose it), holiday prep
- Black Friday/Cyber Monday focus
- December: Planning next year, holiday shutdowns
- **Typical Pattern:** High urgency Oct-Nov, dead December

**Implication for 2026 Targets:**
- Q1 targets must account for slower buying cycle
- Q2 is prime time for agency sales
- Build pipeline in Q1 to close in Q2
- Front-load outreach to overcome Q1 headwinds

---

**Founder-Led Sales (Continuing):**
  - Leverage existing relationships and referrals
  - Focus on happy client referral program
  - Shopify/BigCommerce partner channels
  - Direct outreach to target accounts
  - **Target:** 1-2 clients/month from non-Martal sources

**Future Consideration:**
  - Hire dedicated Sales Executive if Martal proves successful (Q2/Q3 decision)
  - Budget: $90-130k base + 8-10% commission on new business
  - Alternative: Extend Martal contract if ROI positive

#### 6. Reduce Churn from 35% to 20%
- Implement quarterly business reviews (QBRs) for all $10k+ clients
- 90-day renewal outreach before contract expiration
- Contract requirement: Minimum 6-month terms (no more month-to-month for new clients)
- Auto-renewal clauses with 60-day notice
- Annual prepay discount: 10% off for annual payment

#### 7. Shift Contract Mix
- **Current:** 74% Retainer / 26% Project
- **Target 2026:** 85% Retainer / 15% Project

**Strategy:**
- Convert projects to retainers (like Satechi model)
- Offer maintenance retainers to project clients
- Focus sales on retainer engagements

#### 8. Service Strategy by Type

**Development (Target: 59% of revenue)**
- Focus: Shopify Plus, BigCommerce Enterprise
- Target client: $10M+ annual revenue brands
- Average deal: $8-12k/month
- Primary acquisition: Lead gen agency, partner referrals

**Marketing (Target: 31% of revenue)**
- Focus: Cross-sell to existing dev clients
- Services: Email (Klaviyo), Paid Social, SEO, CRO
- Average deal: $5-8k/month
- Primary acquisition: Cross-sell, lead gen agency

**Consulting (Target: 8% of revenue)**
- Focus: Strategic advisory, Fractional CTO/CMO
- Use as door-opener for dev/marketing work
- Average deal: $7-12k/month
- Primary acquisition: Existing network, referrals

   - $8,625 secured through April 2026
   - **No adjustment needed**

**Realistic Starting Point for Q1 2026:**
- Current MRR: $292,946
- Glenmorangie normalization: -$15,000
- Wyze reduction: -$4,200
- **Adjusted baseline: ~$273,746**

**Expected End of Q1 (Before New Sales):**
- Starting: $273,746
- Projects ending: -$44,750 (Blueme, Kyles, SiO, MadEngine, Satechi step-down)
- Normal churn: -$13,650
- SiO conversion: +$6,000 (if successful)
- **Baseline after wind-down: ~$221,346**

**This means Q1 needs to add ~$59k to reach $280k end Q1 MRR target**

## 2026 Sales Targets by Service Type

### Annual New Business Required: $209,844

**Sources of New Business:**
- **New Client Acquisition:** ~$160,000 MRR (76%)
- **Cross-Sells to Existing Clients:** ~$50,000 MRR (24%)

**Note:** Cross-sell projections revised down to $40-58k (6-8 cross-sells) after excluding:
- Past service history (Tori Richard, Wyze, Stikwood)
- Failed cross-sell attempts (United Scope)
- Budget constraints (Pair of Thieves)
- Enterprise complexity (Glenmorangie)

See past-service-history.md and cross-sell-strategy-2026.md for details.

**By Service:**
| Service | New Business | Churn/Loss | Net Growth | End 2026 MRR | % of Total |
|---------|--------------|------------|------------|--------------|------------|
| Development | $110,594 | -$57,844 | $52,750 | $223,541 | 58.5% |
| Marketing | $65,000 | -$31,500 | $33,500 | $117,705 | 30.8% |
| Consulting | $34,250 | -$22,750 | $11,500 | $30,250 | 7.9% |
| Ad-Hoc | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 | 0% |
| **TOTAL** | **$209,844** | **-$112,094** | **$97,750** | **$381,496** | **100%** |

### Client Acquisition Targets

**Total Growth Target: 27-31 new engagements (Revised)**
- **New Unique Clients:** 21-24 clients
- **Cross-Sells to Existing Clients:** 6-8 engagements (down from 8-10)
- Average deal size: $7,000-7,500/month

**Breakdown by Quarter:**
- Q1: 7-9 new clients + 1-2 cross-sells = 8-11 total
- Q2: 3-4 new clients + 2 cross-sells = 5-6 total
- Q3: 5-6 new clients + 2 cross-sells = 7-8 total
- Q4: 5-6 new clients + 1-2 cross-sells = 6-8 total

**By Service (note: some clients may engage for multiple services):**
- Development: 13-16 new client engagements + cross-sells
- Marketing: 9-12 new client engagements + cross-sells
- Consulting: 4-5 new client engagements + cross-sells

**Strategic Reality Check:**
While cross-sells have 5-10x higher close rate and 2x faster sales cycle, viable pool reduced from 27 to ~21 targets after excluding clients with past service history, failed attempts, and budget constraints. New client acquisition becomes slightly more important (76% vs 24% of new business).

**Lead Sources for New Clients (21-24 clients):**
- **Martal Lead Gen:** 8-10 clients (35-40%)
- **Client Referrals:** 5-8 clients (20-30%) ← NEW PROGRAM
- **Founder-led Outreach:** 6-8 clients (25-30%)
- **Inbound (Clutch, Website):** 2-3 clients (10-15%)

**Why Referrals are Critical:**
- Highest close rate (60-80% vs. 25-35%)
- Lowest CAC ($500-2,000 vs. $5,000+)
- Fastest sales cycle (15-30 days vs. 30-60 days)
- Better client fit (referred by happy clients)

## 2026 Quarterly Targets

### Q1 2026: Critical Replacement Phase - REALISTIC ASSESSMENT

**Context: The Perfect Storm**
- Project revenue ending: -$56,844 ✅ **CORRECTED**
  - Blueme $3,500 (ended 11/18), Kyles $4,400 (ended 11/5), SiO $4,500 (ending 11/30)
  - MadEngine Marketing + Consulting $30,000 (ending ~1/2/26)
  - Satechi $14,444 (ending 3/31/26, **converting to $6,250/month retainer 4/1/26** ✅)
- Client revenue reductions (Glenmorangie, Wyze): -$19,200
- Normal quarterly churn: -$13,650
- **Total Q1 headwind: -$89,694** ✅ **CORRECTED**

**GOOD NEWS:** Poseidon & Align Tech renewals removed $17k from month-to-month risk ✅

**Target End Q1 MRR: $280,000**

**Required New Business: $84,000**

**REALITY CHECK - Why Q1 is Extremely Challenging:**

1. **Martal Lead Gen Timeline:**
   - Only 3-6 clients will close in Q1 (not 6-8)
   - Estimated Q1 impact: $22.5-45k MRR
   - Remaining gap to fill: $48-70k

2. **Seasonal Headwinds:**
   - January: Slow buying cycle (post-holiday, budget planning)
   - December: Holiday shutdown affects closing
   - Longer sales cycles in Q1 vs. other quarters

3. **Founder Capacity:**
   - Must also focus on client delivery and retention
   - Sales capacity: realistically 1-2 closes/month from non-Martal sources

**REVISED REALISTIC Q1 TARGET:**

| Metric | Aggressive Target | Realistic Target | Conservative |
|--------|------------------|------------------|--------------|
| New Clients | 10-12 | 7-9 | 5-7 |
| New MRR | $84,000 | $60,000 | $45,000 |
| End Q1 MRR | $280,000 | $260,000 | $245,000 |

**Recommendation: Plan for $260k end Q1 MRR**
- Martal delivers: 4 clients = $30k
- Founder/referrals: 3 clients = $22.5k
- SiO Beauty conversion: 1 client = $6k
- Contract renewals: Save expiring contracts
- **Total new MRR: $58.5k**

This is still ambitious but achievable. Missing the $280k target by $20k is acceptable given the headwinds, and can be made up in Q2 when buying cycles improve.

**By Service (Realistic):**

| Service | New Business | Key Drivers |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Development | $35,000 | Projects ending: -$29,844; Client reductions: -$19,200; Churn: -$8,900; Growth target |
| Marketing | $18,000 | MadEngine ending: -$15,000; Churn: -$4,200; Growth target |
| Consulting | $7,000 | Projects ending: -$18,750; Churn: -$550; Growth target |

**Total Realistic Q1 New Business: $60,000**

**Expected End Q1 MRR: $260,000** (vs. $280k aggressive target)

**New Unique Clients Needed: 7-9** (vs. 10-12 aggressive)

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Martal delivers 4+ closes (67% of expected 3-6)
- SiO Beauty converts to retainer
- Save Q4 2025 expiring contracts (Beach Riot, Glenmorangie, Kindred, Wyze)
- Close 2-3 clients from founder-led/referrals
- Begin building Q2 pipeline now

---

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Q1 2026 Execution (Make or Break Quarter)

**Why Q1 is Critical:**
- $93k new business needed (3x normal monthly run rate)
- $63k in project revenue ending
- $39k in contracts expiring
- Sets momentum for entire year

**Success Requirements:**
- Lead gen agency delivers 6-8 clients minimum
- Close 100% of Q4 2025 expiring contracts
- Convert 80% of month-to-month to 6-12 month contracts

**If Q1 Fails:**
- Will start Q2 at ~$220-230k MRR (vs. target $248k)
- Need to add extra $20-30k/month in Q2-Q4 to compensate
- May not hit year-end target

### 2. Lead Gen Agency Performance

**Trial Period:** Nov 2025 - Jan 2026
**Investment:** Unknown (add if known)
**Guaranteed Deliverable:** 18 Sales Qualified Leads (SQLs)

**Success Criteria for Renewal:**
| Metric | Minimum | Target | Stretch |
|--------|---------|--------|---------|
| SQLs Delivered | 18 | 20 | 25 |
| Close Rate | 30% | 35% | 40% |
| Clients Closed | 5 | 6-7 | 8+ |
| MRR Added | $37,500 | $45,000 | $60,000 |
| Cost per Client | <$6,000 | <$5,000 | <$4,000 |

**If Agency Succeeds:** Renew and scale
**If Agency Fails:** Need to hire internal sales resource Q2

### 3. Churn Reduction

**Current State:** 35% annual churn (unsustainable)
**Target:** 20% annual churn
**Stretch Goal:** 15% annual churn

**Required Actions:**
- [ ] Implement QBR process for all $10k+ clients (monthly for top 10)
- [ ] Create 90-day renewal calendar and outreach workflow
- [ ] Eliminate month-to-month contracts for new clients
- [ ] Build client health scoring system
- [ ] Create early warning system for at-risk accounts
- [ ] Develop win-back program for churned clients

**Financial Impact:**
- Reducing churn from 35% to 20% = ~$39k MRR saved annually
- This would lower new business requirement by $39k

### 4. Month-to-Month Conversion

**Current Month-to-Month Revenue:** $66,840 (24% of MRR)

**Conversion Strategy:**
- Offer 10% discount for 12-month commitment
- Offer 5% discount for 6-month commitment
- Enhanced service package for longer commitments
- Grandfather current pricing (for now)

**Target Conversion Rate:** 80% (save $53k of the $67k)

**Timeline:** Complete by end of January 2026

**Month-to-Month Clients Remaining:** Only 4 (down from 6) - $32,760 total

**Project to Retainer Discussions:**
- [ ] MadEngine - $30k combined - **Confirmed will NOT convert**
  - Focus: Get referrals/testimonial before project ends
- [x] **Satechi - $14,444 → $6,250 retainer (April start) - CONFIRMED CONVERSION** ✅
  - Project ends 3/31/26, retainer starts 4/1/26 for 12 months
  - **SUCCESS STORY** - Use as model for future conversions
- [ ] SiO Beauty - $4,500 project → Target $5-8k retainer
  - Proposal ready before 11/30 delivery

**Shopify Plus Migration Pipeline (CRITICAL for Partner Status):**
- [ ] **Jerome's Furniture** - ~$75k migration project - **Q1 2026 target**
  - Status: On hold due to tariffs
  - Action: Re-engage conversation, assess timeline, position as strategic investment
  - Confidence: 🟡 Medium (needs active nurturing)
- [ ] **Bolle Brands** - ~$100-150k migration (4 brands) - **Q2 2026 target**

  - Required for 2026: 10-12 total migration SQLs → 4-6 closes
  - **CRITICAL:** If <1 migration SQL/month by end Nov, adjust strategy immediately

**Why Migrations are Priority #1:**
- Need 4-6 migrations in 2026 to maintain Shopify Plus Premium/Platinum partner status
- Only 1 migration in past 2 years (BuildDirect 2023) = **4-6x increase required**
- Partner status = credibility, inbound leads, competitive advantage for 2027+

## Risk Factors & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Q1 Target Too Aggressive
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** High

**Mitigation:**
- Front-load lead gen agency engagement
- Activate referral network in December
- Offer Q1 start incentives (discount first month)
- Extend Q4 2025 contracts into Q1 with bonuses

### Risk 2: Lead Gen Agency Underperforms
**Probability:** Medium-High
**Impact:** Very High

**Mitigation:**
- Weekly performance reviews with agency
- Have backup lead sources ready (partnerships, referrals)
- Begin sales hire recruitment in Q1 if agency fails
- Increase founder-led outbound in parallel

### Risk 3: Month-to-Month Clients Don't Convert
**Probability:** Medium
**Impact:** High ($67k at risk)

**Mitigation:**
- Personalized renewal offers per client
- Demonstrate value through case studies/ROI
- Offer better service levels for longer commitments
