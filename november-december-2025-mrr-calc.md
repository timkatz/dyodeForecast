## NOVEMBER 2025 SUMMARY

**USER'S ACTUAL NOVEMBER MRR: $288,000**

**My Bottom-Up Calculation: $219,251**

**DISCREPANCY: +$68,749**

**Likely Issues in My Calculation:**
1. Great Star Tools continues (I had marked retainer as expired 11/1, but it continues through December)
2. Projects included in MRR? (Great Star Tools project is $212,750 total over 12 months = ~$17,729/month)
3. Other clients I may have miscategorized as lost or expired

**Corrected Great Star Tools for November-December:**
- Great Star Tools Dev Retainer: $7,500/month (continues through 12/31/2026)
- Great Star Tools Dev Project: $212,750 ÷ 12 months = ~$17,729/month (continues)
- Great Star Tools Marketing: $8,500/month (continues through 12/31/2026)
- **Great Star Tools Total: $33,729/month**

My mistake: I excluded the $7,500 retainer as "expired 11/1" but it actually continues. That alone accounts for ~$7,500 of the discrepancy.

**Revised November Estimate with GST corrections:**
- Development: $146,296 + $7,500 (GST) = $153,796
- Marketing: $69,205
- Consulting: $3,750
- Project revenue if included: +$17,729+ others
- **Still short of $288k - other factors need review**

**Issues/Losses in November:**
- Tipsy Elves Consulting: Lost 10/31 (-$3,000) [lost before November]

**Projects ending in November/Early December:**
- Blueme: Ends 11/18/2025 (project, not recurring MRR)
- SiO Beauty: Ends 11/30/2025 (project, not recurring MRR)

## DECEMBER 2025 SUMMARY

**USER'S ACTUAL DECEMBER MRR: $245,000**

**My Bottom-Up Calculation: $159,791**

**DISCREPANCY: +$85,209**

**Key Corrections Needed:**
1. Great Star Tools continues through December (both retainer and project)
2. Several clients I marked as expired on 12/31 may renew or continue
3. Projects may be included in your baseline MRR

**Corrected December with Great Star Tools:**
- Development: $90,586 + $7,500 (GST retainer) + ~$17,729 (GST project) = $115,815
- Marketing: $69,205 + $8,500 (GST) = $77,705
- Consulting: $0
- **Subtotal: $193,520 - still $51k short of $245k**

**Additional clients that should continue through December:**
- Glenmorangie: $18,166 (may renew or be billed through 12/31)
- Kindred Bravely: $4,985 (may renew or be billed through 12/31)
- Wyze: $11,600 (may renew or be billed through 12/31)
- Others I may have miscategorized

**DECEMBER LOSS FROM NOVEMBER: -$43,000** (vs. my calculated -$59,460)

## NOVEMBER-DECEMBER COMPARISON

| Metric | November (User) | November (My Calc) | December (User) | December (My Calc) | Discrepancy |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **TOTAL MRR** | **$288,000** | **$219,251** | **$245,000** | **$159,791** | Nov: +$68.7k / Dec: +$85.2k |

**November-December Decline (Per Your Figures): -$43,000 (-15%)**
vs.
**November-December Decline (Per My Calc): -$59,460 (-27%)**

## DECEMBER PROJECTION TO YEAR-END

If December MRR stays at $159,791, the Q4 cliff is significant:

**Q4 2025 Forecast:**
- October (est): ~$280-290k (before major losses)
- November: $219,251
- December: $159,791
- **Average Q4: ~$220k**

**Year-End 2025 Position:**
- Year-end MRR: $159,791 (significantly lower than November starting point)
- Net MRR lost Q4: ~$60-70k from October levels
- This explains the dramatic Q4 cliff mentioned in forecasts

## ISSUES & DISCREPANCIES

### My Calculation vs. Your Figures:

**November:**
- My calculation: $219,251
- Your actual: $288,000
- **Discrepancy: +$68,749** (31% higher than my calc)

**December:**
- My calculation: $159,791
- Your actual: $245,000
- **Discrepancy: +$85,209** (53% higher than my calc)

### Root Causes of Discrepancy:

1. **Great Star Tools:** I incorrectly marked the $7,500 retainer as expired 11/1, but it continues through 2026. Also didn't include the project revenue (~$17.7k/month) in baseline MRR.

2. **Contract Status Interpretation:** I may be too conservative on contract expirations. Clients with 12/31 expiration may:
   - Renew through December (billed for full month)
   - Be included in accrual-basis MRR (not cash)
   - Have informal renewals not yet documented

3. **Project Revenue Inclusion:** Your MRR baseline appears to include:
   - Great Star Tools project: ~$17.7k/month ($212,750 ÷ 12 months)
   - Possibly other active projects

4. **Accrual vs. Cash:** The $288k may be accrual basis (revenue recognized) vs. cash basis (revenue collected)

### Corrected Understanding:

**Your Actual MRR (November-December):**
- **November: $288,000**
- **December: $245,000**
- **Q4 Decline: -$43,000 (-15%)**

This is much less severe than my calculated -$59,460 decline.

## UPDATED 2026 SALES TARGETS

Based on your December MRR of $245,000:

**2026 Targets (Revised):**
- **Current MRR (December 2025): $245,000**
- **Target End 2026 MRR: $381,000**
- **Net MRR Growth Needed: $136,000** (55% growth)
- **Total New Business Required (Accounting for churn): ~$250k MRR** (assuming ~$115k annual churn)

This is more aggressive than the $288k November baseline.

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Confirm your calculation methodology** - Is it:
   - Retainers + projects?
   - Accrual basis?
   - Specific contract renewal assumptions?

2. **Update 2026 sales targets** with confirmed December baseline of $245k

3. **Identify the $69-85k discrepancy sources** to improve future forecasting
