## DECEMBER PROJECTION TO YEAR-END

If December MRR stays at $159,791, the Q4 cliff is significant:

**Q4 2025 Forecast:**
- October (est): ~$280-290k (before major losses)
- November: $219,251
- December: $159,791
- **Average Q4: ~$220k**

**Year-End 2025 Position:**
- Year-end MRR: $159,791 (significantly lower than November starting point)
- Net MRR lost Q4: ~$60-70k from October levels
- This explains the dramatic Q4 cliff mentioned in forecasts

---

## ISSUES & DISCREPANCIES

### Why the $293k figure doesn't match:
The $293k figure in executive summaries appears to be:
1. **November accrued revenue** (not cash basis)
2. **Includes project revenue** that shouldn't be in "MRR"
3. **Rounded/estimated** rather than bottom-up calculated

### Actual Bottom-Up Retainer MRR:
- **November:** $219,251 (retainers only)
- **December:** $159,791 (retainers only)
- **Difference:** -$59,460 due to Q4 contract expirations

### Your $288k Figure:
If you're getting $288k in November, the difference could be:
- Projects included in MRR calculation?
- Different contract status interpretation?
- Clients I may have marked as "lost" but are still paying?
- Pending revenue from Q4 projects?

---

## RECOMMENDATION

The bottom-up calculation shows:
- **November MRR (retainers only): $219,251**
- **December MRR (retainers only): $159,791**

This is significantly lower than the $293k figure previously used, and explains why 2026 sales targets need to be more aggressive ($200k+ in new MRR needed, not just $88-93k).

**Next steps:**
1. Reconcile your $288k figure to understand what's included
2. Clarify if projects should be included in baseline MRR
3. Verify contract expiration dates for accuracy
4. Adjust 2026 targets based on confirmed December baseline
