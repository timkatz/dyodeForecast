## Renewal Conversation Framework

### For Recently-Expired Clients (Beyond Clothing, Cookware Co, L*Space, Stikwood, United Scope, Tori Richard)

**Opening:**
"We want to make sure we're set up properly. Your contract technically expired on [DATE], and we've been serving you on a month-to-month basis. I'd like to lock in pricing and terms that work for both of us."

**Value Pitch:**
- Consistency: Lock in pricing for 6-12 months (no surprises)
- Stability: Plan work more effectively with committed term
- Relationship: Move from transactional (month-to-month) to strategic partnership

**Proposal:**
- Offer: [6 or 12]-month renewal at same rate or slight discount for commitment
- Example: "Let's do a 12-month agreement at current rates - that protects you from any future increases and gives us the visibility to plan your work better."

### For Expiring-Soon Clients (Beach Riot, Glenmorangie, Kindred Bravely, Wyze)

**Opening:**
"Your current agreement expires on [DATE]. Before we get there, let's talk about next year and make sure we're set up for continued success."

**Value Pitch:**
- Success Review: "Here's what we've accomplished together..."
- Forward Planning: "Here's what we see as next steps..."
- Commitment: "A longer-term agreement helps us both plan better"

**Proposal:**
- Standard: 6-month renewal at current rates
- Or: 12-month renewal with [X] specific deliverables/improvements

## Notes & Risks

### High-Risk Factors:
1. **Glenmorangie** - High-value client but engagement declining; needs proactive value conversation
2. **Wyze** - Client mentioned wanting to hire in-house developer; emphasize DYODE's unique value
3. **United Scope** - 2+ years without formal renewal; may need fresh agreement
4. **Stikwood** - Over 10 months without formal renewal; check engagement level

### Opportunities:
1. **Cookware Co** - Long-time client with solid relationship; easy renewal
2. **L\*Space** - Good client history; renewal should be straightforward
3. **Kindred Bravely** - Multi-service client (would be higher retention); leverage for expansion
