# 2026 Cross-Sell Strategy & Account Manager Incentive Program

**Created:** November 2025
**Purpose:** Drive revenue growth through cross-selling additional services to existing clients while incentivizing account managers during salary freeze period

---

## Executive Summary

**The Opportunity:**
- 27 of 30 active clients (90%) only use ONE service
- **~20-21 truly viable cross-sell targets** after excluding:
  - Past service history (Wyze, Tori Richard, Stikwood)
  - Failed attempts (United Scope dev)
  - Frozen budgets (Pair of Thieves)
  - Enterprise complexity (Glenmorangie - challenging)
- Only 3 clients currently have multiple services
- Cross-selling is 5-10x easier than new client acquisition
- Multi-service clients have 50-70% higher retention rates

**2026 Cross-Sell Goals:**
- **Revised Target:** 6-8 cross-sells in 2026 (30-40% conversion rate)
- **Revenue Impact:** $40,000 - $58,000 additional MRR (adjusted down)
- **Strategic Benefit:** Improved retention, lower CAC, stronger client relationships

**Investment:**
- Account Manager incentive program: $10,000 - $16,000 in commissions
- Commission: 5% of contract term value (aligns with typical 3-6 month contracts)
- Alternative to raises that directly drives revenue growth

**Reality Check:** With 5 clients removed/downgraded from viable targets, expectations adjusted to be more realistic.

---

## IMPORTANT: Check Past Service History First

**Before pursuing any cross-sell opportunity, check past-service-history.md**

Some clients have already tried and stopped additional services with DYODE. Key examples:
- **Tori Richard, Wyze:** Previously had marketing (stopped) - DO NOT pitch marketing again
- **Stikwood:** Previously had dev retainer (paused) - LOW PRIORITY, let them come back

**Why This Matters:**
- Saves time on prospects unlikely to convert
- Avoids awkward conversations ("we tried that before")
- May indicate underlying issues (performance, budget, priorities)
- Better to focus on cleaner opportunities

## 2026 Cross-Sell Targets

### Conservative Scenario (Recommended)

| Quarter | Cross-Sells | Avg MRR | New MRR | Cumulative |
|---------|-------------|---------|---------|------------|
| **Q1** | 1-2 | $6,000 | $6,000-12,000 | $6,000-12,000 |
| **Q2** | 2 | $6,500 | $13,000 | $19,000-25,000 |

| **TOTAL** | **6-8** | **$6,600** | **$40,000-53,000** | |

### Aggressive Scenario

| Quarter | Cross-Sells | Avg MRR | New MRR | Cumulative |
|---------|-------------|---------|---------|------------|
| **Q1** | 2 | $7,000 | $14,000 | $14,000 |
| **Q2** | 2 | $7,500 | $15,000 | $29,000 |

**Recommended Target: 6-8 cross-sells = $40,000 - $58,000 new MRR** (reality-adjusted)

**Note:** Target reduced from initial 8-10 cross-sells after excluding:
- Past service history (3 clients)

## Account Manager Incentive Program

### Program Overview

**Purpose:**
Reward account managers for driving cross-sell revenue during salary freeze period, creating win-win alignment between team compensation and company growth.

**Eligibility:**
Any account manager who identifies, proposes, and closes a cross-sell to an existing client they manage.

---

### Incentive Structure

#### Option A: Flat Commission Model (Recommended)

**Commission Rate:** 5% of contract term value (one-time payment)

**Example Payouts:**
- $5,000/month cross-sell x 6-month contract = $25,000 total → $1,250 commission (5%)
- $7,500/month cross-sell x 6-month contract = $45,000 total → $2,250 commission (5%)
- $7,500/month cross-sell x 3-month contract = $22,500 total → $1,125 commission (5%)
- $10,000/month cross-sell x 6-month contract = $60,000 total → $3,000 commission (5%)

**Why This Works Better:**
- Aligns with actual contract terms (typically 3-6 months, not 12)
- Fair to company: only pay commission on contracted revenue
- Fair to AM: higher MRR and longer contracts = higher commission
- Encourages AMs to push for 6-month vs 3-month terms

**Annual Budget:** $12,000 - $20,000 (for 8-10 cross-sells at typical 6-month terms)

**Payment Timing:** 50% upon contract signing, 50% after 90 days (ensures client success)

---

#### Option B: Tiered Bonus Model

**Tier Structure (based on contract term value):**

| Contract Value | Commission Rate | Example Payout (6mo term) |
|----------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| $15,000 - $29,999 | 4% | $600 - $1,200 |
| $30,000 - $49,999 | 5% | $1,500 - $2,500 |
| $50,000+ | 6% | $3,000+ |

**Annual Budget:** $14,000 - $24,000

**Benefit:** Encourages higher-value cross-sells and longer contract terms

---

#### Option C: Quarterly Contest Model

**Structure:**
- Top performer each quarter wins bonus
- Must have minimum 2 cross-sells to qualify
- Bonus pool: $2,500/quarter ($10k/year)

**Drawback:** Only rewards top performer, may demotivate others

---

### Recommended Program: Option A (Flat 5% Commission)

**Why:**
- Simple and transparent
- Rewards all successful cross-sells equally
- Aligns with actual contract terms (3-6 months)
- Encourages longer contract terms (6mo better than 3mo)
- Predictable budget impact
- Fair compensation for effort
- Aligns with "raise alternative" positioning

**Annual Investment:** ~$16,000 for 8 cross-sells at $6,500 avg MRR x 6-month terms
**Annual Return:** $52,000 new MRR → Annualized value $624,000 if retained
**ROI:** 39x return on investment (first year)

**Commission Calculation:**
- Contract Value = Monthly MRR × Contract Term (in months)
- Commission = Contract Value × 5%
- Payment: 50% at signing, 50% after 90 days

---

## Cross-Sell Playbook for Account Managers

### Identifying Opportunities

**Look for these signals:**
1. **Client mentions challenges** in adjacent areas
   - Dev client talks about poor email performance → Marketing opportunity
   - Marketing client mentions site issues → Development opportunity

2. **Client asks questions** outside current scope
   - "Do you do paid social?" = cross-sell signal
   - "Can you help us with X?" = opportunity

3. **Client success** with current service
   - Happy clients are most likely to expand
   - Strong results = credibility for new services

4. **Business growth/changes**
   - New funding, leadership, or strategic priorities
   - Expansion plans or new product launches

5. **Competitive pressure**
   - Seeing competitors pull ahead
   - Need to level up capabilities

---

### Conversation Starters

**For Development → Marketing Cross-Sells:**

> "I've noticed your site traffic has grown 30% since we launched the new features. Are you seeing similar conversion rates, or is there an opportunity to optimize the funnel with email marketing or paid social?"

> "Your development roadmap is really strong. Have you thought about the go-to-market strategy for these new features? Our marketing team has helped similar brands drive adoption with targeted campaigns."

> "I see you're using [Klaviyo/Attentive/etc]. How's your email performance? Our marketing team specializes in revenue-driving campaigns for brands like yours."

**For Marketing → Development Cross-Sells:**

> "Your campaigns are driving great traffic, but I noticed your site speed/mobile experience might be holding back conversions. Have you considered development support to optimize the customer experience?"

> "You mentioned wanting to launch [feature/product]. Our dev team has built similar solutions for [similar client]. Want me to put together a scope?"

> "The email campaigns are working great, but the landing page experience could be better. What if we optimized the entire funnel—both marketing AND development?"

---

### Objection Handling

**"We don't have budget for another service"**
- "What if we started with a pilot—3 months at a smaller scope to prove ROI?"
- "Let's look at the cost of NOT solving this problem. What's it costing you in lost revenue?"
- "Would it help if we phased this in? Start small and scale as you see results?"

**"We already have someone handling that"**
- "That's great! Are they integrated with our work? Sometimes coordination between agencies/teams creates gaps. We could ensure everything works together seamlessly."
- "How's that working? If there are any gaps, we'd love to help fill them as an extension of what's already working."

**"Let me think about it"**
- "Of course! What would you need to see to make this a yes? Let me put together a specific proposal with ROI projections."
- "No problem. Can I schedule 30 minutes next week to walk through exactly how this would work?"

---

### Success Metrics for AMs

- Proposals/quotes sent
- Cross-sells closed
- Commission earned
- 90-day retention rate of cross-sells

## Risk Factors & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Account Managers Too Busy with Delivery

**Probability:** High
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Commission incentive offsets time investment
- Provide templates and playbooks to reduce effort
- Founder involvement in high-value opportunities
- Make cross-selling part of quarterly OKRs

---

### Risk 2: Cross-Sells Cannibalize Existing Service Budget

**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Focus on incremental services, not replacements
- Ensure cross-sells solve NEW problems or needs
- Don't reduce existing service scope to "make room"
- Track carefully: are clients shifting budget or expanding it?

---

### Risk 3: Quality Issues with Rapid Cross-Sell Growth

**Probability:** Low-Medium
**Impact:** High (retention risk)

**Mitigation:**
- Maintain quality standards for all new services
- Dedicated onboarding for cross-sold services
- 90-day check-in required for commission payout
- Don't sacrifice delivery quality for revenue growth

---

### Risk 4: Commission Disputes or Gaming

**Probability:** Low
**Impact:** Medium

**Mitigation:**
- Clear qualifying criteria (3-month minimum, AM-led, etc.)
- Founder approval required before client pitch
- Documentation requirements (CRM notes, emails)
- Good faith interpretation of "who drove the sale"

## Program Communication

### Team Announcement Template

**Subject:** 🎯 New Opportunity: Account Manager Cross-Sell Incentive Program

**Team,**

As we navigate the current revenue environment and salary freeze, I want to create opportunities for you to increase your compensation through performance-based incentives.

**Starting Q1 2026, we're launching an Account Manager Cross-Sell Incentive Program.**

**The Opportunity:**
- 90% of our clients only use ONE of our services
- You know these clients best—their challenges, goals, and needs
- Multi-service clients have higher retention and are more profitable

**The Incentive:**
- **5% commission** on contract term value for cross-sells you identify and close
- Example: Cross-sell a $7,500/month service x 6-month contract = $2,250 commission
- Example: Cross-sell a $10,000/month service x 6-month contract = $3,000 commission
- Longer contracts = higher commission (incentive to sell 6-month vs 3-month)
- Paid 50% at signing, 50% after 90-day success checkpoint

**Next Steps:**
1. Review the Cross-Sell Playbook (attached)
2. Identify your top 3 cross-sell opportunities by [DATE]
3. Schedule 1:1 with me to discuss approach

This is a win-win: our clients get better results, we grow revenue, and you earn additional income.

Let's make 2026 a breakthrough year.
