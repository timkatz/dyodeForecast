# Revised Incentive Structure (Simple Version)

**Created:** December 2025
**Purpose:** Fair, simple commission structure based on actual DYODE org structure
**Status:** DRAFT for co-founder review

---

## Actual Organizational Structure

### Client-Facing Roles (Own Relationships)

**Development Clients:**
- **Project Managers (PMs)** - Day-to-day client management for dev clients
- Overseen by: Director of Project Management (not client-facing)
- Supported by: Director of Web Development + dev team

**Marketing Clients:**
- **Director of Digital Marketing** - Directly oversees marketing engagements
- **Marketing Manager** - Supports director, works together on all marketing accounts
- Small team (2 people) - both hands-on with clients

**Sales/New Business:**
- **Director of Operations** - De facto account executive for inbound leads, builds proposals, closes new deals
- Also oversees: Day-to-day company operations

### Non-Client-Facing Roles

- **Director of Project Management** - Oversees PM team, doesn't directly manage accounts
- **Director of Web Development** - Oversees dev team, occasional technical client interaction

---

## The Simple, Fair Solution

### Who Gets Commissions?

**All client-facing roles get the same commission structure:**

1. **Project Managers** (dev side)
2. **Director of Digital Marketing** (marketing side)
3. **Marketing Manager** (marketing side)
4. **Director of Operations** (new client sales)

**All earn:**
- 5% commission on cross-sells they facilitate
- 5-10% credit on referrals they generate
- $500 credit per Clutch review they collect

### Who Doesn't Get Commissions?

- **Director of Project Management** - Coaches PMs but doesn't own client relationships
- **Director of Web Development** - Manages dev team, not client-facing

**Why this is fair:**
- Commission opportunity is tied to client relationship ownership
- If you're talking to clients regularly, you can earn
- If you're managing internal operations/team, you don't have the same opportunity
- Simple and clear

---

## Program Mechanics

### Cross-Sell Commissions (All Client-Facing Roles)

**How it works:**

**For Project Managers (Dev → Marketing cross-sell):**
- PM identifies marketing need with their dev client
- PM pitches marketing services (with support from Director of Digital Marketing)
- Client signs contract
- **PM earns 5% of contract value**

**For Director of Digital Marketing / Marketing Manager (Marketing → Dev cross-sell):**
- Director or Manager identifies dev need with their marketing client
- They pitch dev services (with support from Director of Web Dev or PM)
- Client signs contract
- **Director or Manager earns 5% of contract value**

**For Director of Operations (New Client Add-On Services):**
- When closing a new client, identifies opportunity for additional services
- Example: New client wants dev, Dir of Ops also sells them marketing
- **Dir of Ops earns 5% on the additional service sold**

**Commission Example:**
- Cross-sell $7,500/month service with 6-month contract = $45,000 total
- Commission: $2,250 (5%)
- Paid: 50% at contract signature ($1,125), 50% after 90-day retention ($1,125)

---

### Referral Credits (All Client-Facing Roles)

**How it works:**
- Any client-facing person asks their client for referrals
- Client refers a brand, introduction made
- Director of Operations (or sales team) closes the deal
- **Person who generated the referral earns 5-10% credit** (tiered by deal size)

**Credit Tiers:**
| Contract Value | Credit % | Example Credit |
|----------------|----------|----------------|
| $15k-30k | 5% | $20k = $1,000 |
| $30k-50k | 7% | $40k = $2,800 |
| $50k-75k | 8% | $60k = $4,800 |
| $75k+ | 10% | $90k = $9,000 |

**Credits:**
- Applied to future invoices or personal services
- 24-month expiration
- Transferable to other team members

---

### Clutch Review Credits (All Client-Facing Roles)

**How it works:**
- Any client-facing person asks their client to write a Clutch review
- Client completes review, gets published
- **Person who collected the review earns $500 credit**

---

### New Client Sales Commission (Director of Operations Only)

**Special addition for Director of Operations:**

Since Dir of Ops is doing sales work (building proposals, closing inbound leads), they should earn commission on new client closes:

**Structure:**
- **3% commission on first-year contract value** for new clients closed
- Only applies to NEW clients (not cross-sells or renewals)
- Paid after 90-day retention milestone

**Example:**
- Close new client: $10k/month x 12 months = $120k first-year value
- Commission: $3,600 (3%)
- Paid after 90 days of retention

**Why 3% instead of 5%?**
- Dir of Ops is already salaried at director level
- 3% is fair compensation for sales work without being excessive
- Keeps budget in check

**2026 Target:**
- 21-24 new clients
- Avg contract value: $90-100k/year
- Dir of Ops earning potential: $6-7k in new client commissions

## Attribution and Tracking

### Simple Google Sheet Tracker

**Columns:**
1. Date Logged
2. Person Name
3. Client Name
4. Opportunity Type (Cross-Sell / Referral / Review / New Client)
5. Service (Development / Marketing / Consulting)
6. Status (Identified / Pitched / Closed / Lost)
7. Contract Value
8. Commission/Credit Amount
9. Payment Status (Pending / 50% Paid / 100% Paid)
10. Notes

**Process:**
1. Person identifies opportunity → Logs in Google Sheet immediately
2. Person pitches and closes → Updates status to "Closed"
3. Co-founders review monthly → Approve commissions
4. Commissions paid within 30 days of contract signature (50%) and 90-day retention (50%)

**Attribution Rules (Keep It Simple):**
- **First person to log the opportunity gets credit** (timestamp in Google Sheet)
- If multiple people contribute, they can split (note in "Notes" column, co-founders approve split)
- Disputed attributions: Co-founders decide case-by-case

## What About Non-Client-Facing Directors?

### Option A: No Variable Comp (Simplest)

**Director of Project Management and Director of Web Development:**
- No commission opportunity during salary freeze
- Focus on coaching their teams to succeed
- Recognize that client-facing roles have unique earning opportunity

**Communication:**
- Be transparent: "We're offering commissions to client-facing roles who can directly drive cross-sells, referrals, and reviews"
- Acknowledge: "We know this doesn't include everyone, but we have a tight budget during the freeze"
- Commitment: "When we lift the freeze, raises will reflect overall contributions (not just commissions earned)"

**Pros:**
- Simplest approach
- Keeps budget tight
- Clear distinction: client-facing = commissions, internal-facing = no commissions

**Cons:**
- These directors may feel left out
- Could create some resentment

---

### Option B: Small Company-Wide Bonus (Inclusive)

**All Directors (including non-client-facing):**
- If DYODE hits $360k+ MRR by end of 2026 (vs. $293k today), all directors split a $15-20k bonus pool
- Each director earns: $3-4k (assuming 5 directors total)

**Client-Facing Roles:**
- Still earn individual commissions on top of company bonus

**Budget:**
- Client-facing commissions: $15-25k
- Company-wide director bonus: $15-20k
- **Total: $30-45k**

**Pros:**
- Includes everyone at leadership level
- Aligns entire team toward company goal
- Still rewards individual performance through commissions

**Cons:**
- Adds $15-20k to budget
- Less direct control (company performance vs. individual effort)

---

### Option C: Role-Specific Mini-Bonuses

**Director of Project Management:**
- $2-3k bonus if team achieves 6+ cross-sells in 2026
- Rewards coaching and enabling the PM team

**Director of Web Development:**
- $2-3k bonus if dev projects generate 3+ marketing cross-sell opportunities
- Rewards quality delivery that creates cross-sell openings

**Budget:**
- $4-6k for non-client-facing directors

**Pros:**
- Gives everyone a path to earn
- Still performance-based
- Lower cost than company-wide bonus

**Cons:**
- Slightly more complex to track
- May feel like "participation trophies" if amounts are too small

---

## Our Recommendation

**Go with "Simplest (Option A)":**

**Who earns commissions:**
- All client-facing roles (Project Managers, Director of Digital Marketing, Marketing Manager)
- Director of Operations (sales + client-facing work)

**Who doesn't:**
- Director of Project Management (coaches team, doesn't own accounts)
- Director of Web Development (manages devs, not client-facing)

**Total budget: $21-37k**

**Why this works:**
1. **Fair:** Everyone who talks to clients can earn
2. **Simple:** Same structure for all client-facing roles, easy to explain
3. **Budget-conscious:** Only adds $9-17k vs. original plan (still tight)
4. **Clear:** If you own client relationships, you can earn commissions
5. **Transparent:** Non-client-facing directors know upfront they're excluded, with clear reasoning

**Communication to non-client-facing directors:**
> "We're offering commission opportunities to client-facing roles during the salary freeze. This includes Project Managers, the marketing team, and Director of Operations (who handles sales). We know this doesn't include everyone, and we recognize your contributions are just as valuable. When we lift the salary freeze, raises will reflect your overall impact on the company, not just commission earnings in 2026."
