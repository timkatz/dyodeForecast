# FINAL APPROVED APPROACH: Sustainable Growth Framework

**Decision Date:** December 2025
**Approved By:** Tim Katz & George, Co-Founders

---

## ❌ SCRAPPED: Individual Incentive Programs

### What We're NOT Doing:

**Cross-Sell Commissions:**
- ❌ 5% commission on contract value for individual PMs/marketing team
- ❌ Monthly commission tracking and payouts
- ❌ Budget: $15-25k in commissions

**Referral Credits:**
- ❌ 5-10% service credits for individuals who generate referrals
- ❌ Tiered credit structure ($1k-$9k credits)
- ❌ Budget: $4-8k in credits

**Review Credits:**
- ❌ $500 per Clutch review for individuals
- ❌ Budget: $2-4k in credits

**Total Scrapped Budget: $21-37k**

### Why We Scrapped It:

✅ **Team has been through enough turbulence**
- 12 layoffs in 18 months
- Raises given → frozen
- Need unity, not division

✅ **Creates inequality after layoffs**
- Client-facing roles can earn, others can't
- Divisive when team just lost colleagues

✅ **Administrative burden**
- Monthly tracking, attribution disputes, calculations
- Overhead for small team

✅ **Saves $21-37k**
- Can reinvest in Martal or other growth initiatives

✅ **Team needs simplicity**
- One clear mission everyone rallies behind
- Not complex programs with haves/have-nots

---

## ✅ APPROVED: Company-Wide Sustainable Growth Framework

### What We ARE Doing:

**One Clear Mission:**
> **Hit 12-15% profit margin for 2 consecutive quarters → Raises unlock for everyone**

**No individual incentives. Everyone benefits when company succeeds.**

---

### Key Components:

**1. Cross-Sells, Referrals, Reviews = Expected Job Responsibilities**

NOT individually incentivized, but required parts of job:

- **Project Managers:** Expected to identify 2-3 cross-sell opportunities in 2026
- **Marketing Team:** Expected to identify 3-4 cross-sell opportunities in 2026
- **Everyone:** Expected to ask happy clients for referrals (1-2 per person)
- **Everyone:** Expected to collect Clutch reviews from satisfied clients (1-2 per person)

**This is part of doing your job well, not optional.**

Just like:
- Responding to emails promptly
- Delivering projects on time
- Attending QBRs

...you're also expected to:
- Identify cross-sell opportunities
- Generate referrals
- Request reviews

---

**2. Financial Guardrails (Never Repeat 2020-2025 Chaos)**

**Rule 1:** No hiring until 12%+ margin sustained for 2 quarters
**Rule 2:** Maintain 20% expense buffer (fixed costs ≤ 80% of revenue)
**Rule 3:** 85% retainer / 15% project mix (predictable revenue)
**Rule 4:** Churn must stay below 25% (currently 35-40%, too high)
**Rule 5:** Build 3-month cash reserve by end of 2027

**These guardrails prevent another crisis.**

---

**3. Transparent Monthly Metrics (Everyone Knows Where We Stand)**

**Monthly Town Hall Dashboard (10 minutes):**
- Profit margin progress ("This quarter: X%, target: 12-15%")
- Revenue & MRR progress
- Client activity (new, lost, net change)
- Growth activities (cross-sells, referrals, reviews closed)
- Team recognition (public shoutouts, no commissions)
- Next month priorities

**Why:** Reduces anxiety, builds trust, shows clear path to raises

---

**4. Quarterly Milestones**

| Quarter | Margin Target | Status | What Happens |
|---------|---------------|--------|--------------|
| Q1 2026 | 5-6% | Building | Programs launch, not at target yet |
| Q2 2026 | 10-11% | Momentum | Getting close to 12% target |
| Q3 2026 | 13-15% | ✅ First qualifying | If hit, need one more quarter |
| Q4 2026 | 13-15% | ✅ Second qualifying | **RAISES UNLOCK!** |

**Best case:** Raises unlock Q4 2026 (Oct/Nov)
**Standard case:** Raises unlock Q1 2027 (Jan/Feb)

**Last raise was Oct 2024 → Next raise Oct 2026 = 2 years (tough but fair given circumstances)**

---

**5. Sustainable Growth Principles**

**Not this:** "Grow fast, hope margin follows"
**But this:** "Grow sustainably, margin first"

**Profitability First:**
- 12-15% margin target (not just revenue growth)
- Never sacrifice margin for growth again

**Controlled Expenses:**
- No hiring until margins support it
- 20% expense buffer for external shocks

**Predictable Revenue:**
- 85% retainer / 15% project mix
- Focus on retention and recurring revenue

**Team Stability:**
- No more whiplash (layoffs → raises → freeze → layoffs)
- Transparent metrics, clear milestones

**Risk Management:**
- Assume external shocks will happen (tariffs, recession)
- Conservative forecasting, not optimistic

---

## What This Means for Each Role:

### Project Managers:
- **Your job:** Retain dev clients, deliver excellence, identify 2-3 cross-sell opportunities, generate 1-2 referrals, collect 1-2 reviews
- **Your incentive:** Company hits 12-15% margin → You get 3-5% raise
- **Your stability:** Company profitability = your job security

### Marketing Team (Director + Manager):
- **Your job:** Retain marketing clients, deliver results, identify 3-4 cross-sell opportunities, generate 2-3 referrals, collect 2-3 reviews
- **Your incentive:** Company hits 12-15% margin → You get 3-5% raise
- **Your stability:** Company profitability = your job security

### Director of Operations:
- **Your job:** Close Martal SQLs and referrals, build proposals, control expenses, support teams
- **Your incentive:** Company hits 12-15% margin → You get 3-5% raise
- **Your stability:** Company profitability = operational flexibility

### Directors (PM, Web Dev):
- **Your job:** Coach teams, improve processes, ensure delivery excellence, enable growth
- **Your incentive:** Company hits 12-15% margin → You get 3-5% raise
- **Your fairness:** Everyone evaluated on total contribution (not penalized for not having client-facing role)

**Everyone benefits when company succeeds. No haves vs. have-nots.**

## Budget Comparison:

| Approach | Investment | ROI |
|----------|------------|-----|
| **Individual Incentives (Scrapped)** | $21-37k | Divisive, complex, administrative burden |
| **Company-Wide Focus (Approved)** | $0 upfront | Unity, simplicity, everyone benefits when raises unlock |

**Money saved ($21-37k) can be:**
- Reinvested in Martal (if pilot successful)
- Held as cash reserve buffer
- Used for mid-year course corrections

## Next Steps:

1. **Co-founders review and approve** sustainable growth framework ✅
2. **Update job descriptions** to include cross-sell/referral/review expectations
3. **Set up monthly town hall template** and dashboard
4. **Prep management team** on messaging (Dec 16-20)

**The goal: Get from 0.3% margin (2025) to 12-15% margin (2026) → Unlock raises for everyone.**

**We avoided $200k loss in 2025. We can hit 12-15% margins in 2026.**
