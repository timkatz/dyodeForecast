## Why These Were Scrapped

**Context:**
After 18 months of turbulence (12 layoffs, raises given then frozen, extreme profit margin volatility), the team needed unity and stability, not division and complexity.

**Key Reasons:**
1. **Unity over division** - Team needed to rally together after layoffs, not compete for individual rewards
2. **Simplicity over complexity** - Small team couldn't support complex tracking and administrative burden
3. **Fairness concerns** - Individual programs favored client-facing roles, penalized others who contribute differently
4. **Budget reallocation** - Saved $21-37k to reinvest in growth initiatives or cash reserve

**What We Did Instead:**
- Company-wide year-end bonuses (graduated $0-$2,000 based on full-year margin)
- Raises unlock when 12%+ margin for 3 consecutive quarters
- Cross-sells, referrals, reviews are expected job responsibilities (not individually incentivized)
- Everyone benefits when company succeeds
