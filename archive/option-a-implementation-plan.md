# Option A Implementation Plan

**Approved:** December 2025
**Decision:** Simple, client-facing roles only ($21-37k budget)
**Next Steps:** Update all strategy documents to reflect approved structure

---

## Summary of Option A (Approved)

### Who Earns Commissions

**Client-Facing Roles (Same 5% Structure for All):**

1. **Project Managers (PMs)** - Manage development client relationships
   - Can cross-sell: Marketing or Consulting to dev clients
   - Can generate: Referrals and reviews from dev clients
   - Earning potential: $3-8k per PM

2. **Director of Digital Marketing** - Manages marketing client relationships
   - Can cross-sell: Development or Consulting to marketing clients
   - Can generate: Referrals and reviews from marketing clients
   - Earning potential: $5-10k

3. **Marketing Manager** - Works hands-on with marketing clients
   - Can cross-sell: Development or Consulting to marketing clients
   - Can generate: Referrals and reviews from marketing clients
   - Earning potential: $3-6k

4. **Director of Operations** - Handles new client sales + proposals
   - Special: 3% commission on new client closes (not 5%)

### Who Does NOT Earn Commissions

**Non-Client-Facing Roles:**

1. **Director of Project Management**
   - Coaches PMs but doesn't directly manage client accounts
   - No commission opportunity

2. **Director of Web Development**
   - Manages dev team, occasional technical client interaction
   - No commission opportunity

**Why This is Fair:**
- Directors earn higher base salaries (20-40% more than ICs/PMs)
- Commission opportunity tied to client relationship ownership
- When raises unlock (based on profit margin), directors evaluated on total contributions (coaching, leadership, process improvement)

## Communication Plan

### To Client-Facing Team (PMs, Dir Marketing, Marketing Manager, Dir Ops)

**Message:**
> "You're eligible to earn commissions and credits through our 2026 growth programs:
> - Cross-sell commissions: 5% of contract value
> - Referral credits: 5-10% of first contract
> - Review credits: $500 each
>
> Earning potential: $3-10k depending on your portfolio and effort. Training session: Dec 11, 2PM."

---

### To Non-Client-Facing Directors (Dir PM, Dir Web Dev)

**Message:**
> "We're launching commission programs for client-facing roles (PMs, marketing team, Dir of Ops) during the salary freeze.
>
> We know this doesn't include everyone. Here's why:
> - Directors earn higher base salaries (20-40% more than client-facing ICs)
> - Commissions are tied to direct client relationship ownership
> - When raises unlock (based on profit margin targets), you'll be evaluated on total contributions: team leadership, coaching, process improvements, strategic impact
> - Commission earnings by others WON'T count against your raise eligibility
>
> See raise-unlock-framework.md for details on when/how raises unlock."

---

### To Entire Team (Town Hall)

**Message:**
> "We're launching three growth programs in 2026:
> 1. Client cross-sells (additional services to existing clients)
> 2. Client referral program (credits for referring new business)
> 3. Clutch review program (credits for collecting reviews)
>
> Client-facing team members (those who manage client relationships directly) can earn commissions and credits through these programs.
>
> We've also defined clear criteria for when salary freeze lifts: when we hit [X]% profit margin for 2 consecutive quarters. See raise-unlock-framework.md for details.
>
> Everyone benefits from company growth: client-facing roles through commissions now, all roles through raises when targets are hit."
