## Comparison to Your Actual December MRR

**Your Actual:** $245,000
**My Calculation:** $276,009
**Discrepancy:** -$31,009 (my calculation is 12.7% HIGHER)

**Possible Explanations:**
1. Projects may have ended mid-month (MadEngine ends ~1/2/2026, might not be full month in Dec)
2. Some retainers may have churned mid-month that I'm not tracking
3. Your figure may be net of adjustments/credits I'm not aware of
4. Billing/accrual methodology differences

Please review December and identify discrepancies.
