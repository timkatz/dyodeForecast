## Clients Who Previously Had Development (Marketing-Only Now)

### Stikwood
- **Current Service:** Marketing ($8,677/month) - Month-to-month
- **Past Service:** Development retainer (paused due to business priorities)
- **Current Development Status:** Ad-hoc work (not reflected in CSV)
- **Reason:** Client business priorities shifted - paused retainer
- **Cross-Sell Recommendation:** ⚠️ LOW PRIORITY - Already aware of dev services
- **Alternative Approach:** Monitor for when priorities shift back. Don't actively pitch, but stay ready.
- **Notes:** They know we do dev. If they need it, they'll come to us. Focus on marketing retention.

- **Cross-Sell Attempted:** Development
- **Outcome:** Unsuccessful - client has in-house developer
- **Reason:** Client prefers to keep development in-house
- **Cross-Sell Recommendation:** ❌ DO NOT pitch development again

## Clients with Budget/Organizational Constraints

### Pair of Thieves
- **Current Service:** Marketing ($12,330/month)
- **Current Status:** Budgets frozen
- **Development Status:** Has ad-hoc developer
- **Cross-Sell Recommendation:** ⏸️ WAIT - Budget constraints
- **Alternative Approach:** Monitor for when budgets unfreeze (likely Q2/Q3 2026)
- **Notes:** High-value client worth pursuing when budget opens up. Don't pitch now.

### Glenmorangie
- **Current Service:** Development ($18,166/month)
- **Parent Company:** LVMH (large enterprise)
- **Cross-Sell Opportunity:** Marketing ($8-12k/month potential)
- **Cross-Sell Recommendation:** ⚠️ CHALLENGING - Enterprise decision-making
- **Why Challenging:** LVMH ownership may mean centralized marketing or existing agency relationships
- **Alternative Approach:** Worth exploring given strong relationship, but set expectations low
- **Notes:** Great dev relationship. Marketing pitch may face enterprise barriers. Try but don't count on it.

## Guidelines for Using This Document

### Before Pitching Any Cross-Sell:

1. **Check this list first** - Don't waste time on clients who've already tried and stopped
2. **Ask "Why did they stop?"** - If we don't know, find out before re-pitching
3. **Time matters** - If they stopped 3+ years ago, context may have changed (new team, budget, priorities)
4. **Different ≠ Better** - Don't assume "we're better now" - they may have had valid reasons

### When to Update This Document:

- Any time a client stops a service (even if they keep another)
- When you learn the reason why they stopped
- If circumstances change (new leadership, budget, strategy) that might reopen the door
- After attempting a cross-sell that fails due to past history

### Red Flags That Suggest Past Service Issues:

- "We tried that before" or "We used to do that with you"
- Vague reasons for stopping ("priorities shifted," "budget")
- Quick/abrupt discontinuation without clear explanation
- Client seems uncomfortable when service is mentioned

## Additional Context Needed

**To improve this document, we should document:**

- [ ] Complete history of all services tried and stopped
- [ ] Reasons for discontinuation (if known)
- [ ] Whether issues were performance-based, budget-based, or priority-based
- [ ] Any other clients with past service history

**Action:** Review past client records to identify other clients with similar patterns
