## Overview

**What is DYODE?**
eCommerce agency providing Shopify/BigCommerce development, digital marketing, and consulting services to brands with $10M+ revenue.

**Current State (Nov 2025):**
- Revenue: ~$3.4M, MRR: $293k, Profit Margin: 0.3% (breakeven)
- 30 active clients
- Team in salary freeze after 18 months of turbulence (12 layoffs)

**Historical Context:**
Peak revenue of $4.86M (2022) declined to $3.4M (2025) through aggressive hiring, market contraction, tariff impacts, and extreme quarterly profit margin volatility (1.3% → 5.5% → 8.5% → 0.1% in 2025).

**2026 Goals:**
- Revenue: $4.2M, MRR: $370-380k
- Profit Margin: 12%+ sustained for 3 consecutive quarters
- Reduce churn from 35-40% to 20-25%
- Stable, sustainable growth (not boom-bust cycle)
