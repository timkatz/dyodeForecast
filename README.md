## Overview

**What is DYODE?**
eCommerce agency providing Shopify/BigCommerce development, digital marketing, and consulting services to brands with $10M+ revenue.

**Current State (November 2025):**
- Revenue: $3.6M accrual / $3.4M cash (YTD through October), MRR: $288.5k (Nov 2025), Profit Margin: 0.26% cash basis (breakeven)
- 30 active unique clients, 53 total clients (30 active unique, 20 lost in 2025)
- 58 service engagements total (28 service losses in 2025)
- Team in salary freeze after 18 months of turbulence (12 layoffs in April 2024, 2 additional in 2025)

**Historical Context:**
Peak revenue of $4.86M (2022) declined to $3.4M (2025) through aggressive hiring, market contraction, tariff impacts, and extreme quarterly profit margin volatility (1.3% → 5.5% → 8.5% → 0.1% in 2025).

**2026 Goals:**
- Revenue: $4.2M, MRR: $370-380k
- Profit Margin: 12%+ sustained for 3 consecutive quarters
- Reduce churn from 35-40% to 20-25%
- Stable, sustainable growth (not boom-bust cycle)
