### 2. Finalize Bonus Amounts (If Needed)

**Current Structure:**

| 2026 Full-Year Avg Margin | Bonus Per Person |
|---------------------------|------------------|
| 0-3% (no improvement) | $0 |
| 4-6% (modest) | $400 |
| 7-9% (significant) | $750 |
| 10-11% (close to goal) | $1,250 |
| 12%+ (goal achieved) | $2,000 |

**Questions:**
- Do these amounts feel right?
- Too generous? Too conservative?
- Should we adjust tiers?

**Action:** Confirm or revise

---

### 3. Confirm Team Size for Budget

**Current assumption:** ~40 people

**Action:** Confirm actual headcount for budget calculations

**Impact on budget:**
- 30 people: ~$60k max (vs. ~$80k)
- 40 people: ~$80k max
- 50 people: ~$100k max

## ❓ Outstanding Questions to Answer

- [ ] How much detail to share about 2025 volatility? (Recommended: full transparency)

### Bonus Mechanics:

- [ ] Who tracks? (Director of Operations? Co-founders?)
- [ ] Monthly or quarterly tracking? (Recommended: monthly town halls, quarterly deep dives)

### Raise Mechanics (When Unlock):

## 🚨 Critical Decisions Needed

### Decision 1: Approve or Revise Approach?

**Options:**
- ✅ **Approve as-is:** Company-wide bonuses + raises (3 quarters at 12%+)
- ⚠️ **Revise bonus amounts:** Adjust tiers or amounts
- ⚠️ **Revise unlock criteria:** Different margin target or quarters
- ❌ **Reject and restart:** Go back to individual incentives approach

**Recommendation:** Approve as-is (well-reasoned given your context)

---

### Decision 2: Communication Timing?

**Options:**
- **Option A:** January 2026 kickoff (Recommended)
  - Pros: Fresh start, aligns with growth plan launch
  - Cons: Team waits through holidays with uncertainty

- **Option B:** December 2025 (Before holidays)
  - Pros: Team knows plan before holidays, reduces anxiety
  - Cons: Adds pressure during holiday season

- **Option C:** Late January / Early February 2026
  - Pros: Gives more prep time
  - Cons: Delays momentum

**Recommendation:** Early January (week of Jan 6-10) - fresh start, not too early, not too late

---

### Decision 3: Management Team Prep?

**Question:** Do you prep management team (directors) before all-hands, or announce to everyone at once?

**Option A: Prep management first** (Recommended)
- Dec 16-20: Meet with directors, explain plan, get buy-in
- Jan 6-10: All-hands with unified management support

**Option B: Announce to everyone at once**
- Jan 6-10: All-hands, everyone hears at same time
- Pros: Transparency, no "insiders"
- Cons: Directors unprepared to answer questions

**Recommendation:** Option A (prep management first for smoother rollout)

## 🎯 Key Reminders

**What We're Doing:**
- Company-wide focus (NO individual incentives)
- Year-end bonuses (Jan 2027, graduated by performance)
- Raises unlock when 12%+ margin for 3 consecutive quarters
- Cross-sells/referrals/reviews are expected job responsibilities
- Transparent monthly metrics (everyone sees where we stand)

**Why This Approach:**
- Team needs stability after 18 months of turbulence (12 layoffs)
- 2025 proved 2 quarters isn't enough (8.5% → 0.1% collapse)
- Unity over division (everyone benefits together)
- Rewards progress, not just perfection (graduated bonuses)
- Sustainable growth, not boom-bust cycle

**Budget:**
- Year-end bonuses: ~$16-80k (depending on performance)
- Raises (when unlock): ~$70-110k annual
- Total: ~$100-180k over 2 years

**Timeline:**
- Jan 2027: Year-end bonuses paid (14 months from last raise)
- Q1-Q2 2027: Raises unlock (if criteria met)
