## ❓ Quick Reference: Compensation Structure

### Year-End Bonuses (January 2027)
Based on 2026 full-year average profit margin:

| Margin | Bonus Per Person |
|--------|-----------------|
| 0-3% | $0 |
| 4-6% | $400 |
| 7-9% | $750 |
| 10-11% | $1,250 |
| 12%+ | $2,000 |

### Raise Unlock Criteria
- **Target:** 12%+ profit margin
- **Duration:** 3 consecutive quarters (or full-year 2026 average of 12%+)
- **Size:** 3-5% merit-based raises
- **Timing:** Q2 2027 earliest (if Q2+Q3+Q4 2026 all hit 12%+)

### Why 3 Quarters (Not 2)?
- 2024: Hit 2 consecutive quarters at 8%+ → Gave raises
- 2025: Margins collapsed to 0.1% → Had to freeze raises again
- 3 quarters proves sustained improvement, not temporary spike

## 🎯 Key Reminders

**What We're Doing:**
- Company-wide focus (NO individual incentives)
- Year-end bonuses (Jan 2027, graduated by performance)
- Raises unlock when 12%+ margin for 3 consecutive quarters
- Cross-sells/referrals/reviews are expected job responsibilities
- Transparent monthly metrics (everyone sees where we stand)

**Why This Approach:**
- Team needs stability after 18 months of turbulence (12 layoffs)
- 2025 proved 2 quarters isn't enough (8.5% → 0.1% collapse)
- Unity over division (everyone benefits together)
- Rewards progress, not just perfection (graduated bonuses)
- Sustainable growth, not boom-bust cycle

**Budget:**
- Year-end bonuses: ~$16-80k (depending on performance)
- Raises (when unlock): ~$70-110k annual
- Total: ~$100-180k over 2 years

**Timeline:**
- Jan 2027: Year-end bonuses paid (14 months from last raise)
- Q1-Q2 2027: Raises unlock (if criteria met)
