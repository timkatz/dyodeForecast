# DYODE 2025 Recap & 2026 Strategy
## Executive Summary for Co-Founders

**Prepared:** November 2025
**Confidential:** Co-Founder Eyes Only

---

## The Bottom Line

**2025 Reality Check (Forecasted):**
- Current MRR: **$288,508 accrued** (down from $350k+ peak, as of Nov 2025)
- **Forecasted 2025 Accrual Revenue:** **$3.589M** (-10.1% YoY, Nov-Dec accrual: $544k)
- **Forecasted 2025 Cash Revenue:** **$3.414M** (-14.2% YoY, Nov: $287k, Dec: $245k)
- **Accrual-to-Cash Gap:** **$183.5k**
  - **Primary driver:** $165k distressed AR (Movano $46k, The Bruery $66k, other late payers $53k)
  - **Secondary driver:** ~$53k accruals in Nov-Dec not yet collected by year-end
  - **AR Recovery Potential:**
    - **The Bruery ($66k):** Recently stated they can't pay now but targeting year-end or Q1 — **should push for payment plan to accelerate Dec/Jan collections**
    - **Movano ($46k):** Held payment due to merger uncertainty, just announced merger this week — **unlikely to pay immediately as a public company with merger complications, but worth pursuing**
    - **Other late payers ($53k):** Standard collection follow-up needed
    - **Scenario if Bruery pays in Dec/Q1:** Could swing full year from -$47.7k to near breakeven
- **Forecasted 2025 Net Profit:**
  - **Accrual basis:** ~$100-120k (2.8-3.3% margin)
  - **Cash basis:** -$47.7k (-1.4% margin)
  - YTD through Oct cash: +$7.5k (barely breakeven)
  - Q4 operating loss: -$55.2k (Nov: -$4.5k + Dec: -$50.8k)
    - Driven by revenue cliff (Satechi project end + consulting losses) while expenses remain elevated
- 3-Year Decline: **Down 26% from $4.88M peak (2022)**
- Churn Rate: **40% all clients incl. projects/ad-hoc** (21 of 53) / **37% retainer clients** (14 of 38) — Both significantly above 15-20% industry benchmark

**2026 Ambition:**
- Target MRR: **$381,496 accrued** (46% growth needed)
- Target Revenue: **$4.2M accrued**
- Strategic Imperative: **Reverse 3-year decline or face continued erosion**

**Critical Notes:**
- **Accrual basis:** All MRR and revenue figures are accrued revenue unless otherwise noted (cash basis shown for 2025 comparison only)
- Accrual revenue matches MRR tracking, but cash reality is tighter due to AR from equity/relationship situations (not typical collections issues)

**The Challenge:** We need to add **$212.5k in new MRR (accrued)** while fighting **37% retainer churn** (40% across all clients incl. projects/ad-hoc) in a market with frozen client budgets and increasing competition.

**The Strategy:** Multi-channel growth approach combining new client acquisition, cross-selling, referrals, and churn reduction.

## 2025: What Happened

### Historical Decline: Accrual Basis

| Year | Revenue | YoY Change | Net Profit | Profit Margin |
|------|---------|------------|------------|---------------|
| 2022 | $4.88M | Peak | $382k | 8.5% |
| 2023 | $4.86M | -0.6% | $475k | 10.8% |
| 2024 | $3.99M | -20% | $202k | 5.6% |
| 2025 (Forecast) | **$3.597M** | **-10.0% (slowing decline)** | **$100-120k** | **2.8-3.3%** |

*Note: Cash basis will be $183.5k lower ($3.414M) due to $165k distressed AR (Movano $46k, The Bruery $66k, other $53k) plus ~$53k in Nov-Dec accruals not yet collected by year-end. The remaining accrual difference of Nov-Dec ($585k accrual vs. $532k cash) represents invoices issued in Q4 but not fully collected within 2025.*

**Cash Basis Reality (Operating Loss Q4):**

| Year | Cash Revenue | YoY Change | Net Profit | Profit Margin |
|------|---|---|---|---|
| 2022 | $4.86M | Peak | $383k | 7.89% |
| 2023 | $4.71M | -3.1% | $350k | 7.45% |
| 2024 | $3.98M | -15.4% | $362k | 9.09% |
| 2025 (Forecast) | **$3.414M** | **-14.2% (sharper than accrual)** | **-$47.7k** | **-1.4%** |

**Full Year Cash Basis Forecast (User's Actual Forecast):**

- **YTD through October:** $2.881M net income collected
  - Profit: +$7.5k (barely breakeven)
- **November forecast:** $287k cash revenue vs. $292k expenses = **-$4.5k loss**
  - Satechi project billing ends ($36k/3mo contract Sep-Nov)
  - $13.5k Satechi revenue deferred to Q1 2026
- **December forecast:** $245k cash revenue vs. $296k expenses = **-$50.8k loss**
  - Satechi project revenue completely ends
  - Consulting client losses: 3HNails ($8k) + Tipsy Elves Consulting ($3k) no longer billable
- **Full Q4 deficit:** -$55.2k

**2025 Cash Forecast Summary:**
- Strong profitability through October (+$7.5k)
- Steep cliff in Q4 due to Satechi project end + consulting client losses (3HNails $8k, Tipsy Elves Consulting $3k)
- Full year ends at -$47.7k cash loss (-1.4% margin)
- **Company was on track to be profitable until Q4 revenue cliff**

**Root Causes:** Unsustainable churn (40% vs. 15-20% benchmark), failed lead gen experiments (SDRs, Cleverly), no scalable pipeline until Martal, 24% month-to-month contracts, 26% project dependency, and economic headwinds (tariffs, budget freezes). See management summary for detailed analysis.

### Current Client Base (November 2025)

**Active Clients:** 30 unique clients (58 service engagements)
- Development: 61% of MRR ($179k)
- Marketing: 29% of MRR ($84k)
- Consulting: 6% of MRR ($19k)
- Ad-Hoc: 4% of MRR ($12k)

**Critical Issues:**
- **$92k MRR at high risk** (31% of total):
  - $33k month-to-month clients (Posiedon Bikes, Align Tech, DITA, Stikwood, Tori Richard, United Scope) — no contract protection
  - Glenmorangie: 2025 accrual Q1 $50k, Q2 $46k, Q3 $67k (no Q4 planned) → 2026 forecast $22.5k/quarter minimum (-55% reduction)
  - Wyze: $11.6k/mo → Risk of in-house dev hiring in 2026 (potential loss of $140k/year)
- **Additional headwind:**
  - No net new booked projects in Q4 2025 going into 2026
- **Mitigating factors:**
  - Poseidon Bikes renewed 12-month contract (was month-to-month)
  - Align Tech renewed 6-month contract (was month-to-month)
  - Satechi confirmed converting to $6.25k/mo retainer 4/1/2026

**2025 Churn Analysis:**
- Clients added: 13 unique clients
- Clients lost: 20 unique clients (21 retainer services + 7 projects/ad-hoc = 28 total service losses)
- **Net: -7 unique clients** (Tipsy Elves retained as multi-service)

- **Marketing Retainers:** 8 lost ($65.4k MRR - includes Buttercloth, The Bruery, and Zgallerie Marketing $15.992k)
- **Consulting Retainers:** 3 lost ($21k MRR: 3HNails $8k + Cavaco $4k + Zgallerie Consulting $9k) + Tipsy Elves service reduction ($3k) = **$24k total consulting impact**
- **Projects/Ad-Hoc:** 7 lost (~$224.5k in project revenue - includes Wix at $39k)

**Churn by Client Type:**
- **All clients (incl. projects & ad-hoc):** 20 of 53 clients lost = **38% churn rate**
- **Retainer clients only:** 13 of 38 retainer clients lost = **34% churn rate**
  - Still **2x+ industry benchmark** of 15-20%
- **Multi-service client retention: 100%** (4 of 4 retained, including Tipsy Elves who lost Consulting but kept Dev)

**2025 Service-Level Losses Summary:**
- Development Retainers: -$25.1k MRR (4 complete losses + Great Star Tools $4k reduction)
- Marketing Retainers: -$65.4k MRR (8 complete losses)
- Consulting Retainers: -$24k MRR (3 complete losses + Tipsy Elves $3k reduction)
- **Total Retainer MRR Lost: ~$114.5k**
- Projects/Ad-Hoc: ~$224.5k (natural completions)
- **Total 2025 Service Loss: ~$339k annual revenue impact**

**Key Insight — Expectation-Setting Failures:**
- 3HNails & Cavaco: Founder-led deals with undefined scope (client assumptions vs. explicit commitments)
- Tipsy Elves: Lost Consulting but retained Development, proving multi-service resilience
- **See management summary for detailed client-by-client churn analysis**

### What We Did Right

1. **Launched Martal partnership** (Nov 1, 2025) - $18k/quarter for refined ICP targeting with 18 guaranteed SQLs
2. **Google Ads delivered 4 clients** (TripleK, Blueme, Kyles, Nowadays) - below ICP but proof of concept
3. **Founder-led sales closed 3 clients** (Pair of Thieves, 3HNails, Tipsy Elves) - effective but ad hoc
4. **Stabilized MRR at $290k** in Q3-Q4 despite challenges and maintained key relationships (AG Jeans, Great Star Tools, Glenmorangie)

### What We Tried But Failed (Lessons Learned)

**Timeline:** SDRs (early-mid 2025) → Cleverly (mid-late 2025) → Martal (Nov 1, 2025 - pilot in progress)

1. **In-house SDRs** (tried sequentially, ~3 months each):
   - Full-time W2 SDR (~$70k/year)
   - 1099 offshore contractor ($2.5k/month, Latin America)
   - Activities: Cold email, LinkedIn outreach, cold calling
   - Result: **0 meetings, 0 deals** → Let both go

2. **Cleverly agency** (~$2k/month for 3 months, after SDRs failed):
   - Smaller team, high-volume batch-and-blast approach
   - Activities: Cold email, LinkedIn outreach, LinkedIn ghost writing for founder profile
   - No SQL guarantees, less refined targeting
   - Result: Few meetings but **all below ICP, 0 deals** → Stopped

**What We're Testing Now:**

3. **Martal partnership** ($6.7k/mo = $18k/quarter, launched Nov 1, 2025 - 3-month pilot):
   - **Key differences from Cleverly:**
     - Larger team: 2 SDRs + account manager (vs. small team at Cleverly)
     - Account Based Marketing (ABM) with personalized outreach (vs. batch-and-blast)
     - Refined ICP targeting: Shopify Plus, $10M+ revenue merchants
     - **18 guaranteed SQLs** over 3 months (vs. no guarantee)
   - Activities: Personalized cold email, LinkedIn, cold calls
   - **Too early to evaluate** - will assess results in Jan 2026

**Lesson:** Cold outbound has failed twice (SDRs, Cleverly). Martal is testing a different approach (ABM vs. batch-and-blast, SQL guarantee, refined ICP), but still unproven. **Must diversify with warmer channels** (referrals, inbound, tradeshows) regardless of Martal outcome - can't rely on one unproven channel.

---

### What We Didn't Do (But Need To)

1. ❌ **Systematic client retention process** (QBRs, renewal outreach, health monitoring)
   - Lost $96k MRR from 13 retainer clients; many were preventable with better account management
   - Marketing especially vulnerable (56% churn rate = 6 of ~11 marketing retainers lost)

2. ❌ **Clear expectation-setting for founder-led deals** (3HNails & Cavaco failed due to misaligned expectations)
   - 3HNails: Client expected 30+ marketplace integrations (unrealistic scope), we didn't promise it but they interpreted it that way ($8k/mo lost)
   - Cavaco: Unclear what referral support would look like ($4k/mo lost)
   - Solution: Document and agree on specific deliverables/outcomes before contract signature

3. ❌ **Leverage existing clients** for cross-sells and referrals (30 clients = untapped asset)
4. ❌ **Build social proof** (Clutch reviews, case studies, testimonials)
5. ❌ **Enforce minimum contract terms** (too many month-to-month, no commitment)
6. ❌ **Make founder-led sales systematic** (works when done, but ad hoc with no process/goals)
7. ❌ **Optimize Google Ads for ICP** (bringing in clients, but below target profile/deal size)

## The Competitive Reality: Why Positioning & Content Matter

### Market Shifts (2023-2025)

**1. Proliferation of Shopify Agencies**
- When DYODE launched, Shopify partner ecosystem was smaller and less commoditized
- Today: Hundreds of agencies claim Shopify expertise
- Result: Increased competitive pressure, price-focused negotiations, harder differentiation

**2. Macro Headwinds**
- **Inflation (2024):** Tightened client budgets
- **Tariffs (2025):** eCommerce margins under pressure, clients risk-averse on service spend
- **AI Rise (2023-2025+):** Disrupting traditional service delivery model, changing buyer expectations

**3. Competitor Sophistication**
- Larger agencies with stronger brands and better-resourced content
- More sophisticated positioning and thought leadership
- Clearer value proposition communication
- Better "web presence" credibility

### DYODE's Competitive Gap

**What we're missing:**
- Strategic positioning beyond "we do Shopify development + marketing"
- Content ecosystem that warms prospects before sales conversations
- Landing pages tied to specific problems and solutions
- Differentiated narrative leveraging founder expertise (VP-level eCommerce experience)
- Sales assets that communicate "strategic partner" vs. "service vendor"

**What happens if we ignore this:**
- Continued commodity competition → Price-focused negotiations → Lower margins
- Outbound campaigns (Martal, ads, LinkedIn) reaching cold prospects with weak landing pages
- Prospects comparing us on services + price instead of strategy + results
- Competitor-friendly buying environment

### Our Unique Differentiator

**Tim and George bring:**
- VP-level eCommerce experience from billion-dollar omnichannel retailers
- Strategic thinking (not just tactical execution)
- Enterprise-scale perspective on unit economics, retention, growth loops
- Omnichannel context (not web-siloed)

**Why this matters:**
- Mid-market eCommerce brands ($10M-100M+) desperately need VP-level strategic guidance
- Most agencies hire junior resources and deliver execution only
- DYODE can bridge that gap: Strategy + Expert Execution
- Shopify Plus merchants specifically need this

**The opportunity:**
- Strategic partner positioning enables 20-30% premium pricing over commodity agencies
- Founder involvement + thought leadership creates real competitive moat
- Content authority is hard to replicate (requires consistency + expertise)

### Investment: Market Positioning & Content Lead

**What's needed:**
- Dedicated resource to establish strategic positioning
- Content ecosystem (landing pages, blog, case studies, resources)
- Sales enablement materials aligned to positioning
- Website redesign reflecting strategic positioning

**Resource options:**

1. **Fractional VP of Growth** ($3-5k/month) — 12 months = $36-60k
   - Positioning strategy, messaging framework, content roadmap
   - Lighter lift, more flexible, can adjust based on results

2. **Senior Content/Growth Hire** ($90-115k/year) — Full-time
   - More expensive but deeper integration with team and strategy
   - Better for long-term brand building

3. **Hybrid Approach** (Recommended) — Fractional lead (3-4 months) + contract content production
   - Establishes strategy and positioning, then outsources execution
   - Total: $54-90k for Phase 1 (positioning + landing pages)

**Expected ROI:**
- Improved lead quality → Higher conversion rates → +$15-25k MRR
- Improved pricing power → Strategic positioning justifies 10-15% premium → +$15-25k MRR
- Total: $30-50k additional MRR potential vs. $54-90k investment = 4-8 month payback

**Recommendation:**
- **Approve fractional VP of Growth resource ($3-5k/month) starting December 2025**
- **First 90 days:** Positioning strategy, messaging framework, buyer personas, content roadmap
- **Next 90 days:** Landing pages, blog content, case studies, website strategy
- **Decision point:** January 2026 — Evaluate impact on Martal/Google Ads conversion before scaling

## 2026 Critical Path: What Must Happen

**Three interconnected business imperatives for 2026 — all must succeed:**

### 🎯 **IMPERATIVE 1: FOUNDER-LED SALES (Make or Break)**
**Why it's critical:** Only reliable revenue source if Martal fails (like SDRs + Cleverly); feeds both revenue growth AND Shopify Plus migrations

**2026 Targets:**
- **Tim:** 2-5 deals, $19.5-55k new MRR (~$5-15k avg MRR per deal, Development primary, marketing secondary)
- **George:** 2-5 deals, $19.5-55k new MRR (~$5-15k avg MRR per deal, Marketing primary, development + consulting secondary)
- **Combined:** 4-10 deals, $39-110k new MRR (~$5-15k avg MRR per deal) + 0.4-0.8 consulting upsells
- **Time commitment:** 2 hours/week per founder
- **Success metric:** Monthly pipeline tracking, scope validation calls, overachievement visibility

**Direct connection to Shopify Plus:** Founder-led deals should include migration opportunities; if Bolle re-engages or founder outreach generates Plus migration leads, this directly supports partner tier goal.

---

### 🏗️ **IMPERATIVE 2: EXECUTE JEROME'S PROJECT (Q1-Q2 2026)**
**Why it's critical:** Locks in 1 of 4+ Shopify Plus migrations needed for Premier tier; $250-278k revenue; creates resource demand that tests team capacity

**2026 Targets:**
- Contract signed: December 2025 ✅ (on track)
- Project start: January 2026
- Successful delivery: June 2026 (6 months)
- Budget/scope: $250-278k (revised from $360-390k)
- Concurrent execution: Great Star Tools Shop-Vac project + regular retainers

**Critical dependencies:**
- Resource planning (dev team capacity for overlapping projects)
- Governance setup (milestones, timeline, communication)
- Success feeds confidence for Shopify Plus tier credibility

---

### ⭐ **IMPERATIVE 3: HIT 4+ SHOPIFY PLUS MIGRATIONS FOR PREMIER TIER (Q1-Q3 2026)**
**Why it's critical:** Business continuity; without Premier/Platinum badge, lose competitive edge and inbound lead flow in 2027+; 61% of MRR ($178k) comes from Shopify merchants

**2026 Migration Targets:**
- **Q1:** Jerome's ($250-278k) ✅ LOCKED IN
- **Q2:** Bolle Brands ($100-150k) or Martal close 🔴 LOW CONFIDENCE
- **Q3:** Martal + Founder-Led ($75-150k) **← DEPENDS ON FOUNDER-LED EXECUTION**
- **Total needed:** 3 additional after Jerome's to hit 4+ for Premier tier

**Migration sources (in order of reliability):**
1. **Founder-led sales** (Tim + George) — 1-2 expected migrations from $39-110k in new deals
2. **Martal migration SQLs** (10-12 opps) — 2-3 closes at 35% conversion (UNPROVEN, 3rd attempt)
3. **Bolle Brands re-engagement** (if they come back in Q1) — 1 close
4. **Shopify referrals** — 0-1 close (upside)

**Critical dependency:** If founder-led sales doesn't execute, losing 1-2 potential migrations makes hitting 4+ very difficult (would need Martal + Bolle + Shopify to all work perfectly).

---

### **PRIORITY ORDERING (What Gets Attention First)**

| Priority | Program | Investment | Reason |
|----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| **🔴 1** | **Founder-Led Sales** | $0 (time only) | Lowest cost, highest reliability, feeds both revenue AND Shopify migrations |
| **🔴 2** | **Jerome's Execution** | $0 (already sold) | Already committed, must succeed, locks in 1 Plus migration + $250k revenue |
| **🔴 3** | **Churn Reduction** | Minimal (process) | Losing 37% MRR annually; retention worth 2-3x acquisition |
| **🟡 4** | **Martal Migration Focus** | $72k/year | Unproven but only scalable source for remaining 2-3 migrations; needs explicit Plus migration focus |
| **🟡 5** | **Paid Ads (Google only)** | $72k/year | Proven channel (Google); hold LinkedIn/Meta for 2027 if proven |
| **🟡 6** | **Bolle Re-engagement** | $0 | Upside; reach out in Jan 2026 if silent through year-end |
| **🟢 7** | **Cross-Sells/Referrals/Reviews** | $35-58k | Nice upside ($50-100k+ potential) but secondary to new client acquisition |
| **🟢 8** | **Tradeshows** | $40-65k | High risk (0 clients 2025), high cost; deprioritize unless clear ROI in Q1 |

---

### **2026 Success Definition**

**You succeed if:**
- ✅ Jerome's project delivers successfully (Q1-Q2)
- ✅ Founder-led sales hits $39-110k new MRR target (Tim + George)
- ✅ Hit 4+ Shopify Plus migrations by Q3 for Premier tier
- ✅ Retain 65%+ of retainers (reduce from 63% to 65% churn rate)
- ✅ End 2026 at $381k+ MRR accrued ($4.2M revenue target)

**You're in trouble if:**
- ❌ Jerome's slips or fails (impacts both revenue and Premier tier)
- ❌ Founder-led sales underperforms (backup plan gone + 1-2 fewer migrations)
- ❌ Bolle + Martal both disappoint (only Jerome's counts, need 3 more with limited sources)
- ❌ Churn continues at 37%+ (revenue growth gets washed away)

---

## 2026 Strategy: Multi-Channel Growth Approach

### The Math

**Starting Point (Adjusted for Q4 losses):** ~$260-273k MRR (accrued)
**Target End 2026:** $381k MRR (accrued)
**Net Growth Needed:** $108-121k MRR (accrued)
**Accounting for Churn:** ~$112k expected losses (accrued)
**Total New Business Required:** **$209-220k MRR (accrued)**

**This means:** We need to replace 100% of churned clients PLUS add 46% net growth.

---

### Revenue Channels: Diversified Portfolio Approach

| Channel | Contribution | Close Rate | CAC | Investment | Status |
|---------|--------------|------------|-----|------------|--------|
| **Martal Lead Gen** | 8-10 clients ($60-75k MRR) | 30-40% | $5-7k | $72k/year | Unproven |
| **Client Referrals** | 5-8 clients ($37-60k MRR) | 60-80% | $500-2k | $20-35k (credits) | New |
| **Cross-Sells** | 6-8 expansions ($40-58k MRR) | 30-40% | $1-2k | $10-16k (commissions) | New |
| **Founder-Led (systematic)** | 4-6 clients ($30-45k MRR) | 35-45% | $500-1k | $2-5k (tools) | Proven |
| **Inbound (Clutch)** | 2-3 clients ($15-22k MRR) | 40-50% | $2-4k | $5-7.5k (review credits) | New |
| **Tradeshows** | 0-4 clients ($0-30k MRR) | 0-25% | Variable* | $40-65k (cash) | Unproven** |
| **Paid Ads (Multi-Channel)*** | 9-15 clients ($60-105k MRR) | 5-10% lead conversion | $8-15k CAC | $120-240k (cash) | Google proven; LinkedIn/Meta new |
| **TOTAL** | **31-52 additions** | **~30% avg** | **~$8k avg** | **$269-430.5k** | Mixed |

*Tradeshows: CAC varies widely; 2025 eTail = infinite CAC (0 clients), prior years = ROI positive
**Tradeshows: eTail 2025 = 0 clients; prior years had "a few"; ShopTalk/CES = networking only

**Strategic Rationale:**
- **Diversified risk:** 7 channels, 2 unproven (Martal, tradeshows). If both fail, 5 proven/new channels compensate
- **Double down on what works:** Google Ads and Founder-Led already delivered in 2025 - systematize and optimize
- **Optimized CAC:** Referrals ($500-2k), Cross-sells ($1-2k), and Founder-Led ($500-1k) bring down blended CAC
- **Quality over volume:** Referrals, face-to-face (tradeshows), and founder credibility = better fit, higher retention
- **Leverage existing assets:** 30 active clients are underutilized for cross-sells and referrals
- **Brand building:** eTail West booth maintains market presence (even if 0 conversions like 2025)
- **Highest ROI first:** Founder-Led (100-150x) and Cross-Sells (30-45x) are prioritized over expensive experiments
- **Realistic expectations:** Tradeshows may deliver 0 clients (like eTail 2025), but brand value + ShopTalk meeting strategy worth testing

## The Seven Growth Programs

### 1. Cross-Sell Incentive Program (Internal)

**Opportunity:**
- 26 of 30 clients (87%) use only ONE service
- Only 4 multi-service clients currently (13%)
- ~20-21 viable targets after excluding past failures

**Multi-Service Client Performance (Proof of Concept):**
- **0% complete client loss** in 2025 (0 of 4 multi-service clients lost)
- **46% single-service client loss** in 2025 (21 of ~46 lost)
- **Multi-service clients = 3.6x higher value** ($34k avg vs. $9.5k)
- **Evidence:** Tipsy Elves lost Consulting service but retained Development
- **Multi-service clients are dramatically stickier**

**Program:**
- Account managers earn 5% of contract term value
- Example: $7,500/month x 6-month contract = $2,250 commission
- Alternative to raises during salary freeze

**Targets:**
- 6-8 cross-sells in 2026
- $40-58k new MRR
- Investment: $10-16k in commissions
- ROI: 30-45x

**Key Constraints:**
- Some clients already tried/failed other services (United Scope, Wyze, Tori Richard)
- Budget freezes (Pair of Thieves)
- Enterprise barriers (Glenmorangie - LVMH owned)

**Decision Needed:** Approve commission structure and timing

---

### 2. Client Referral Program (External)

**Opportunity:**
- Referrals have 60-80% close rate vs. 30-40% other channels
- Clients are well-connected in eCommerce space
- Lowest CAC channel

**Program:**
- Clients earn 5-10% of first contract value in service credits
- Tiered based on deal size ($15k = 5%, $75k+ = 10%)
- Credits apply to future invoices (not cash)

**Targets:**
- 5-8 referrals converting to deals
- $250-400k revenue
- Investment: $20-35k in credits
- ROI: 10-15x

**Risk Mitigation:**
- 60-day clawback if referred client churns
- ICP targeting (Shopify Plus, $10M+)
- Credit-based (keeps clients engaged vs. cash)

**Decision Needed:** Approve credit structure and budget

---

### 3. Clutch Review Incentive (External)

**Opportunity:**
- Clutch reviews drive 30-40% of inbound agency leads
- Currently under-leveraged (need more reviews)
- Social proof critical for Shopify Plus prospects

**Program:**
- $500 service credit per qualified review
- Requirements: 4+ stars, 100+ words, specifics

**Targets:**
- 10-15 reviews in 2026
- Investment: $5-7.5k in credits
- ROI: 10-20x (inbound lead impact)

**Decision Needed:** Approve $500 credit amount

---

### 4. Martal Partnership Optimization

**Status:**
- Launched Nov 1, 2025
- 3-month pilot through Jan 2026
- $18k/quarter ($6.7k/mo) for 2 SDRs + account manager

**What's Different from Previous Failed Attempts:**
- **ABM approach:** Personalized outreach vs. batch-and-blast (Cleverly)
- **SQL guarantee:** 18 guaranteed SQLs vs. no guarantees (Cleverly, SDRs)
- **Refined ICP:** Shopify Plus, $10M+ revenue merchants
- **Larger team:** 2 SDRs + account manager vs. smaller teams
- **Still unproven:** Too early to know if this approach works

**Realistic Expectations (Conservative):**
- Q1 closes: 3-6 clients (accounting for 30-60 day sales lag + holiday slowdown)
- Not counting on 6-8 closes given past failures

**Q1 2026 Decision Point:**
- If 4+ closes: Renew and scale
- If 2-3 closes: Evaluate ROI, may need to adjust
- If <2 closes: Consider alternative lead gen

**Investment:** $18k/quarter (~$72k annually if renewed)

**Decision Needed:** Renewal criteria and budget allocation

---

### 5. Tradeshow & Sponsorship Strategy

**Opportunity:**
- Direct access to qualified eCommerce decision-makers
- Build brand visibility and credibility in industry
- Generate high-quality leads and strategic partnerships

- Hotel (4 people, 4 nights): $2,500
- Flights (4 people): ~$1,600-2,000
- **Total: ~$21,900-22,300**
- **Historical performance:** Prior years = a few clients, 2025 = 0 clients
- **2026 expectation:** 0-2 clients (conservative given 2025 performance)
- **ROI logic:** 1 client pays for entire show; 0 is possible, 2+ is upside

**CES (January, Las Vegas) - NETWORKING ONLY:**
- Tickets: Free
- Hotel (2-4 people, 4-5 nights): ~$800-1,600
- Flights (2-4 people): ~$800-1,600
- **Total: ~$1,600-3,200**
- No sponsorship/booth - pure networking and relationship building
- Expected: 5-10 conversations, 0-1 client (if lucky)

**ShopTalk (March, Las Vegas) - MEETING-BASED STRATEGY:**
- Tickets: ~$2,000-3,000
- Hotel (2-4 people, 3-4 nights): ~$800-1,600
- Flights (2-4 people): ~$800-1,600
- **Total: ~$3,600-6,200**
- **Strategy:** Build target list → Martal books meetings outside show → Face-to-face at show
- Not sponsoring booth - leveraging Martal to schedule targeted meetings
- Expected: 5-10 scheduled meetings, 0-1 client conversion

**Tier 2: High Priority Expansion (Test Additional Shows)**

**Expo West (March, Anaheim) - LOCAL ADVANTAGE:**
- Badge/ticket: $500-900 (if qualify as retailer/buyer badge; full exhibitor $9,750)
- Setup: Minimal (attending, not exhibiting)
- Hotel (2-3 people, 2-3 nights): ~$600-900
- Travel: **LOCAL - can drive** (Anaheim to LA, ~$50 gas/parking)
- **Total: ~$1,150-1,850**
- **Vertical:** Food & Beverage (expanding into CPG)
- **Strategy:** Test F&B vertical, leverage local advantage (no flights), low-cost expansion
- **Expected:** 10-15 conversations, 0-1 client (new vertical test)

**Commerce Next (June 24-26, NYC) - ECOMMERCE/DTC FOCUS:**
- Tickets: ~$1,800-2,700 (2 people)
- Hotel (2 people, 3-4 nights): ~$1,200-1,800
- Flights (2 people): ~$800-1,200
- **Total: ~$3,800-5,700**
- **Vertical:** eCommerce/DTC (perfect ICP fit)
- **Strategy:** Pure eCommerce show, high ICP alignment
- **Expected:** 15-20 conversations, 0-1 client

**ShopTalk Fall (Sept 29-Oct 1, Nashville) - RETAIL/ECOMMERCE:**
- Tickets: ~$1,400-2,100 (2 people)
- Hotel (2 people, 3 nights): ~$600-900
- Flights (2 people): ~$800-700
- **Total: ~$2,800-3,700**
- **Vertical:** Retail/eCommerce
- **Strategy:** Second ShopTalk exposure (spring already committed), test Nashville market
- **Expected:** 10-15 conversations, 0-1 client

**Tier 2 Total: ~$7,750-11,250**

**Tier 3: Opportunistic (Budget Reserved)**
- Co-sponsor dinners with partners/vendors: ~$3,000-5,000
- Additional regional show opportunities: ~$4,000-10,000
- **Total: ~$7,000-15,000**
- **Status:** Opportunistic, not committed

**Total Investment:** $40-65k (Tier 1 committed: $26-31k, Tier 2 expansion: $7.75-11.25k, Tier 3 opportunistic: $7-15k)

**Realistic Targets (Conservative - All 6 Shows):**
- **Tier 1 (Committed):** 20-30 qualified conversations, 0-2 client conversions
- **Tier 2 (Expansion):** 35-50 additional conversations, 0-2 client conversions
- **Combined:** 55-80 qualified conversations across 6 shows
- **SQLs generated:** 5-10 strong SQLs (eTail booth, ShopTalk meetings, Commerce Next/Expo West networking)
- **Client conversions:** 0-4 total (acknowledge 0 is possible like eTail 2025, but more shows = more chances)
- **Revenue IF conversions happen:** $0-300k (not guaranteed)

**ROI:** 0-7x (wide range: 0 is possible, 5-7x if we get 3-4 clients)

**Strategic Value:**
- **Brand visibility:** eTail West booth positions DYODE as established player (even if 0 conversions)
- **Relationship building:** Face-to-face meetings are higher quality than cold outreach
- **Martal synergy:** ShopTalk uses Martal to pre-book meetings (test if their outreach converts better face-to-face)
- **Team morale:** Opportunity for team to network and represent company
- **Realistic expectations:** Acknowledge 0 clients is possible (like eTail 2025) but brand value still exists

**Decision Needed:** Approve $26-56k tradeshow budget ($26-31k committed, $15-25k opportunistic)

### 6. Multi-Channel Paid Advertising Strategy

**Current State (Google Ads Only):**
- Launched March 2025 with $6k/month budget
- Geographic focus: Southern California (LA, OC, SD), recently expanded to all California
- **2025 Performance (Apr-Oct):** $31,437 spend → 41 leads → 4 clients closed
  - **CPL: $1,310** (much higher than B2B benchmark of $75-150)
  - **CPA: $7,859 per client** ($31,437 ÷ 4 deals)
  - **Deal value: $65,850** (TripleK $25.95k, Kyles $22k, Blueme $14k, Nowadays $3.9k)
  - **ROI: 2.1x** ($65,850 revenue ÷ $31,437 spend) - actually solid despite high CPL
- **Problem:** All 4 clients are below ICP (smaller businesses, smaller deal sizes); broad targeting drives high CPL
- **What works:** Google Ads DOES generate leads and close deals (unlike SDRs/Cleverly); conversion rate is ~10% (4 of 41 leads)

**2026 Strategy: Multi-Channel Expansion**

**Phase 1 (Q1 2026): Test 3 channels at $10k/month**

**Google Ads: $6k/month ($72k/year) - Optimization Focus**
- **2025 Baseline:** $31,437 spend → 41 leads → 4 clients (CPL $1,310, CPA $7,859)
- **2026 CPL Target: $1,000-1,200** (slight reduction from $1,310; this is the baseline cost for enterprise eCommerce, not a dramatic improvement)
- **2026 Expected Results:** At $72k spend and $1,000-1,200 CPL = 60-72 leads → 6-8 clients (if lead-to-client conversion rate stays ~10%)
- **Optimization approach (keyword strategy already solid):**
  - **Keyword targeting:** Already optimized for "Shopify Plus agency" with negative keywords (freelancer, irrelevant terms)
  - **New Ad Group Testing:** Break out ad groups by intent (migrations, CRO/ongoing optimization, site speed optimization) to identify which keywords have better conversion rates
  - **Lead quality focus:** Test which keyword clusters convert best to clients (migrations likely highest intent, recurring optimization second)
  - **ICP landing pages:** Separate enterprise-focused pages for each ad group (migration landing page, CRO landing page, site speed optimization landing page)
  - **Bid strategy:** Use "Target CPA" or "Maximize Conversions" on highest-performing ad groups
  - **Geographic:** Already expanding beyond California to national
- **Note:** $1,300 CPL is realistic baseline for acquiring $10M+ revenue eCommerce enterprises; focus is on lead quality/conversion rate, not CPL reduction

**LinkedIn Ads: $3k/month ($36k/year) - NEW**
- Target: eCommerce Directors, VP of Marketing at $10M+ revenue companies
- CPL estimate: $75-150 for B2B (converts 3x better than Facebook for B2B)
- Campaign types: Sponsored content, InMail, retargeting
- Target: 1-2 ICP-fit clients in 2026
- Why: Best channel for reaching enterprise decision-makers

**Meta/Instagram Ads: $1k/month ($12k/year) - NEW**
- Target: Brand awareness, retargeting, lower-funnel
- CPL estimate: $20-30 for B2B
- Campaign types: Retargeting, lookalike audiences, case study promotion
- Target: 0-1 clients (awareness play)
- Why: 83% of B2B marketers use Facebook; cheap retargeting

**Total Phase 1 Budget: $10k/month = $120k/year**

**Phase 2 (Q2-Q4): Scale Based on Results**
- **Google:** If highest-performing ad groups (migrations, CRO, site speed) show CPL < $1,000 and 15%+ lead-to-client conversion: Increase to $10-12k/month, double down on best performers
- **Google:** If CPL stays $1,200-1,500 but lead quality improves (higher deal sizes, Shopify Plus focus): Keep at $6k/month, accept higher CPL if leads are better fit
- **LinkedIn:** If CPL < $150 and generating qualified SQLs: Increase to $5-6k/month
- **Meta:** If CPL < $50 and generating engagement: Keep at $1k/month
- **Pull back:** If any channel's CPL > $1,500 (Google), $200 (LinkedIn), $75 (Meta) without corresponding lead quality improvement
- **Metric to track:** Lead-to-client conversion rate by ad group (migrations vs. CRO vs. site speed) — not just CPL

**Industry Benchmarks for $3.6M Revenue Agency:**
- Conservative: 3-5% of revenue = $108-180k/year
- Moderate: 5-7% of revenue = $180-252k/year
- **DYODE 2026: $120-240k = 3.3-6.7% (conservative-to-moderate)**

**2026 Targets (Combined Channels):**
- **Google Ads:** 60-72 leads → 6-8 clients (at $1,000-1,200 CPL + 10-12% conversion; focusing on best-performing ad groups)
- **LinkedIn Ads:** 24-48 leads → 2-4 clients (at $75-150 CPL, higher conversion rate for B2B decision-makers)
- **Meta/Instagram:** 24-60 leads → 1-3 clients (awareness + retargeting, lower conversion but brand building)
- **Combined:** 108-180 leads → 9-15 clients
- **Blended CAC: $12.5-15k** ($120-240k spend ÷ 9-15 clients)
- **Note:** Higher blended CAC than referrals/cross-sells, but scalable and proven. Google CPL staying ~$1,000-1,200 is acceptable for enterprise segment.

**Investment:** $120k (Phase 1) → up to $240k (Phase 2 if proven)

**Expected Return:** $540-900k revenue (9-15 clients at $5-10k avg MRR, blended across all channels)
- Conservative: 9 clients × $60k annual value = $540k
- Base case: 12 clients × $60k annual value = $720k
- Optimistic: 15 clients × $60k annual value = $900k

**ROI:** 4.5-7.5x (solid returns; higher volume compensates for $1,000+ CPL on Google)

**Decision Needed:**
- Approve $120k Phase 1 budget (Google $72k + LinkedIn $36k + Meta $12k)
- Approve landing page development ($5-10k)
- Commit to monthly reporting and optimization

### 7. Founder-Led Sales Systematization (Tim & George Partnership)

**Current State:**
- **What's working:** Tim and George closed 3 clients in 2025 (Pair of Thieves, 3HNails, Tipsy Elves) plus Bolle Brands pipeline (~$100-150k)
- **Why it works:** Founder credibility, direct decision-maker access, personal relationships close deals that SDRs/agencies can't
- **Current performance (2025 closures):**
  - Tim: 21 active clients managed, 30% churn, $144.5k MRR
  - George: 7 active clients managed, 53% churn, $33.7k MRR
- **Main problem:** Ad hoc, no goals, no process, only happens when we remember or business slows

**Current Issue: Expectation Misalignment**

Recent client losses revealed a validation gap in the deal structuring phase:
- **3HNails:** Client assumed we could launch them on 30+ marketplaces in 90 days; we didn't promise this but couldn't deliver their expectation (misaligned scope)
- **Cavaco:** Promised to refer 10 clients from our network; unrealistic for a consulting firm with limited referral track record (unrealistic commitment)
- **Wix:** Promised Wix migration referrals; unrealistic without proven sales track record to make those guarantees (unrealistic commitment)

**Root cause:** Scope expectations weren't validated or documented upfront. Deals came in with unclear or unrealistic promises (marketplace access, referrals, migration guarantees) that weren't formally documented or challenged during onboarding.

**What Needs to Change:**

**1. Clearer, More Realistic Contracts:**
- Define specific, deliverable outcomes (not vague promises like "marketplace access" or "client referrals")
- Document what we WILL and WON'T do upfront, with clear success metrics
- Get client sign-off on scope before engagement starts (not verbal agreements)
- Examples of what NOT to include: "30+ marketplace integrations," "10 referrals from DYODE," "Wix migration guarantees"
- Goal: Legal clarity and shared understanding; if it's not in the contract, we're not promising it

**2. Stronger Legal Protections:**
- Ensure contracts include scope limitations and realistic timelines
- Add language that distinguishes between what we deliver vs. what clients need to do
- Require written approval on scope changes (not ad-hoc scope creep)
- Make clear what we can't guarantee (marketplace vendor relationships, referral outcomes, integration availability)

**3. Set Clear Individual Goals (Based on Portfolio Analysis):**

**EQUAL 2026 MRR TARGETS FOR BOTH PARTNERS:**
- **Tim & George each: $19.5-55k new MRR target** (combined $39-110k)
- **Same targets, different strategies** (based on what works for each)
- **Overachievement tracked separately** (e.g., if George hits $60k, that's +$5k upside)

---

**TIM'S 2026 FOUNDER-LED STRATEGY:**
*Current portfolio: 21 active clients ($315k MRR), 32% churn, strength in Development*

- **Service focus:** Development retainer clients ($8-18k MRR range)
  - Why: Tim retains Development clients at 73% rate (only 27% churn); best results in $5-18k range
  - Leverage: Satechi, AG Jeans, Glenmorangie, Wyze, Align Tech model
  - Secondary: Marketing $5-12k (5 active, 44% churn, $8.3k average)

- **Target profile:** Mid-market eCommerce brands ($10M-50M revenue), Shopify Plus/Advanced migrations, ongoing optimization retainers

- **2026 Goals to hit $19.5-55k new MRR:**
  - Development clients: 2-4 clients at $8-18k each
  - Marketing clients: 0-2 clients at $8-12k each
  - **Churn target:** Maintain 30-35% (currently 32%)
  - If overachieve: Track secondary Marketing strength

- **Outreach:** 12-15 personalized messages/month, focus on Development decision-makers

- **Time commitment:** 2 hours/week

---

**GEORGE'S 2026 FOUNDER-LED STRATEGY:**
*Current portfolio: 7 active clients ($127k MRR), 53% churn, organizes Marketing team (Director of Digital Marketing, Marketing Manager)*

- **Service focus:**
  - **Primary:** Marketing retainers ($8-20k) for team capacity
  - **Secondary:** Development retainers ($5-8k) to complement marketing
  - **High-margin:** Consulting engagements (1-2 month audit/strategy + fractional VP roles) as profit driver + pipeline to Dev/Marketing

- **Consulting model (high-margin, intentional churn):**
  - Structure: 1-2 month audit + strategy engagement OR ongoing fractional VP of eCommerce (max 6 months)
  - Why: High margin (you deliver, no hiring needed), drives upsells to Development/Marketing services
  - Expected outcome: Explicit agreement upfront that engagement ends when you staff internally (e.g., they hire full-time CMO/eCommerce VP)
  - Monetization: 10% of new hire's salary as referral fee when they staff the role
  - Current active: MadEngine consulting $45k (this is the model working correctly)
  - Failed examples: 3HNails ($8k) and Cavaco ($4k) failed due to OTHER promises bundled in (marketplace access, referral commitments), not the consulting structure itself

- **Current active portfolio:** 3 marketing (MadEngine $45k, United Scope $12.6k, Poseidon $8.6k) + 2 Development (Tipsy Elves $7.5k, L*Space $5k) = $82.1k MRR from 7 clients

- **2026 Goals to hit $19.5-55k new MRR:**
  - Marketing retainers: 2-4 at $8-20k each (primary team focus)
  - Development retainers: 1-3 at $5-8k each (secondary, complements marketing)
  - Consulting engagements: 1-2 at $3-8k/month for 1-6 months (high-margin profit + pipeline to Dev/Marketing)
  - **Consulting upsells target:** 40% conversion rate (historical) = 1 consulting engagement should upsell to dev/marketing
    - Expected: 1-2 new consulting engagements → 0.4-0.8 dev/marketing upsells at $5-12k each = $5-10k additional MRR
    - Timeline: Upsells typically happen during or within 30 days of consulting exit
  - **Total path to target:** Base recurring (2-4 marketing + 1-3 dev) + consulting margin + consulting upsells
  - **Churn improvement target:** Reduce from 53% to 45% by better expectation-setting on consulting (explicit 6-month exit plan, salary referral fee, clear scope) and validating marketing scope upfront
  - **Key metric:** Grow portfolio from 7 to 12-15 clients by Q4 2026 (5-8 new), including 1-2 consulting engagements + 1-2 consulting-driven upsells

- **Outreach:** 12-15 personalized messages/month, target eCommerce decision-makers (CMOs, marketing directors, Chief eCommerce Officers) in your network

- **Time commitment:** 2 hours/week

- **CRITICAL Validation checkpoint:**
  - For consulting: Explicit discussion of 6-month timeline, internal staffing plan, 10% salary referral fee structure
  - For marketing: Validate scope upfront (success metrics, team capacity, timeline to results)
  - For all deals: NO bundled promises (marketplace access, client referrals, etc.) beyond the core service
  - 3HNails/Cavaco failed because of BUNDLED promises, not because consulting is bad

**3. Build Process:**
- **ICP targeting list:** Each partner maintains rolling list of 30-50 target companies
- **Outreach cadence:** Block 2 hours/week for outreach (suggested: Tim Tue/Thu mornings, George Mon/Wed mornings)
- **Personalization framework:** Use recent news, mutual connections, specific pain points
- **Follow-up sequence:** 3-touch sequence (initial, +5 days, +10 days)
- **Scope validation checkpoint:** Before finalizing any deal, partner review on 3 questions:
  1. Does client understand what we do (and don't do)?
  2. Are there any unrealistic scope promises (marketplace access, referral commitments, etc.)?
  3. Is this a retainer we'll realistically keep for 12+ months?

**4. Leverage Existing Network:**
- LinkedIn connections: Warm intros vs. cold outreach (track by partner)
- Industry events: Follow up with tradeshow connections (each partner owns their connections)
- Client referrals: Ask for intros to peers (both partners ask their networks)

**5. Track & Optimize:**
- CRM tracking: All outreach logged with results (separate columns for each partner)
- Monthly review: What's working, what's not (partner call to discuss trends)
- Quarterly adjustment: Refine messaging, targeting, churn patterns

**2026 Combined Targets (Tim + George - EQUAL TARGETS):**
- **Combined MRR target:** **$39-110k new recurring MRR** ($19.5-55k per partner from recurring + consulting)
- **Org-aligned service focus:**
  - Tim (leads Development team): Primary Development (73% retention), secondary Marketing
  - George (leads Marketing team): Primary Marketing, secondary Development + high-margin Consulting
- **Consulting strategy:** Intentional short-term engagements (1-2 month audits + fractional VP roles, max 6 months) as profit driver + pipeline to Dev/Marketing, with 10% salary referral fee monetization
- **Monthly outreach:** 24-30 personalized messages (12-15 each partner)
- **Conversion targets:** 6-10 SQLs per partner per year, ~50% conversion rate

**Expected Performance by Service Type:**
- **Development:** 3-7 new clients (Tim primary 2-4 at $8-18k, George secondary 1-3 at $5-8k) + 1-2 consulting-driven upsells at $5-12k = 4-9 total dev clients, likely 73%+ retention
- **Marketing:** 2-4 new clients (George primary 2-4 at $8-20k, Tim secondary 0-1) = improve from 62% churn through better scope validation and explicit expectations
- **Consulting:** 1-2 high-margin engagements per partner (1-6 month duration) as profit driver + upsell pipeline
  - Expected "churn": Intentional; structured exit when client hires internally
  - Revenue model: Monthly fees ($3-8k/month) + 10% of new hire salary as referral fee
  - **Upsell conversion rate:** 40% historical (George's data: 2 of 5 consulting engagements upsold to dev/marketing)
  - **2026 projection:** 1-2 consulting engagements → 0.4-0.8 dev/marketing upsells at $5-12k each = $5-10k additional MRR

**Overachievement Tracking:**
- If George hits $60k (vs. $19.5-55k target): +$5k tracked as upside (recurring or consulting mix)
- If Tim hits $60k: +$5k tracked as upside
- Goal: Transparent tracking of who delivers above-target MRR by service type and deal quality

**Investment:** Minimal ($2-5k for CRM, tools, templates)

**Expected Return:** $468-1,320k revenue over 12 months (6-8 clients at blended $6.5-15k avg MRR)
- Conservative (6 clients × $78k annual): $468k
- Base case (7 clients × $100k annual): $700k
- Optimistic (8 clients × $165k annual): $1,320k

**ROI:** 94-264x (time is primary cost; negligible cash)

**Critical Success Factors:**
- **Expectation-setting over deal type:** The issue with 3HNails/Cavaco wasn't consulting itself—it was BUNDLED promises (marketplace access, client referrals) that aren't realistic. Clear scope = success even for consulting.
- **Consulting model clarity:** Both partners should use structured consulting (1-2 month audit + strategy OR 6-month fractional VP max) with explicit exit plan. Current working model: MadEngine ($45k consulting working correctly because expectations are clear).
- **Org-aligned sourcing:** Tim sources for Development team capacity, George sources for Marketing team capacity + consulting for margin. Each partner aligns with their delivery model.
- **Marketing scope validation:** George's marketing churn (62%) improves with upfront scope validation (success metrics, team capacity, timeline) and clear expectations about what the team can deliver.
- **Consulting monetization:** 10% salary referral fee when clients hire internal staff keeps consulting profitable beyond the engagement period.
- **Transparent overachievement tracking:** If either partner exceeds target, upside tracked separately by service type (recurring vs. consulting mix)

**Decision Needed:**
- Approve **equal $19.5-55k MRR targets for both Tim and George** (same expectation, org-aligned service focus + consulting)
  - Tim: Primary Development (2-4 new clients at $8-18k) + secondary Marketing (0-1 at $5-12k)
  - George: Primary Marketing (2-4 at $8-20k) + secondary Development (1-3 at $5-8k) + high-margin Consulting (1-2 engagements)
  - Consulting model: 1-2 month audits + 6-month fractional VP roles max, with explicit exit plan + 10% salary referral fee
- Commit to 2 hours/week systematic outreach (each partner)
- Institute 30-minute scope validation call before finalizing any deal over $5k MRR
  - For consulting deals: Validate upfront that client understands 6-month max, internal hiring plan, and salary referral fee structure
  - For marketing deals: Validate scope upfront (success metrics, team capacity, realistic timeline) to prevent 62% churn repeat
  - For all deals: Flag any BUNDLED promises (marketplace access, client referrals, etc.) that go beyond core service scope
- Monthly partner review to track results, churn patterns, overachievement, consulting exit/staffing outcomes, and upsell conversions
  - Specific tracking: Consulting engagement → client hires internally → upsell to dev/marketing (track timing and MRR value)
  - Goal: Monitor 40% upsell conversion rate and adjust approach if underperforming
- Implement CRM or simple spreadsheet tracking to monitor progress against target (separate by partner, by service type: recurring vs. consulting, plus consulting-driven upsells)

| **Referrals** | $20-35k (credits) | $250-400k revenue | 10-15x | New program |
| **Cross-Sells** | $10-16k (commissions) | $480-696k revenue | 30-45x | New program |
| **Reviews** | $5-7.5k (credits) | $50-100k revenue | 10-20x | New program |
| **Tradeshows** | $40-65k (cash)** | $0-300k revenue | 0-7x | Unproven*** |
| **Paid Ads*** | $120-240k (cash) | $540-900k revenue | 4.5-7.5x | Google proven, LinkedIn/Meta new |
| **Founder-Led** | $2-5k (tools) | $468-1,320k revenue | 94-264x | Tim Dev + George Marketing/Consulting |
| **TOTAL** | **$269-430.5k** | **$2.57-3.81M revenue** | **7-9x** | Mixed risk profile |

*Paid Ads = Multi-channel (Google $72-120k + LinkedIn $36-72k + Meta $12-48k)
**Tradeshows: Tier 1 $26-31k (eTail, CES, ShopTalk), Tier 2 $7.75-11.25k (Expo West, Commerce Next, ShopTalk Fall), Tier 3 $7-15k (opportunistic)
***Tradeshows: eTail 2025 = 0 clients; prior years = "a few"; 2026 expectation = 0-4 clients across 6 shows

**Budget Considerations:**
- **Most programs are performance-based:** Referrals, cross-sells, and reviews only pay when results happen
- **Credits vs. cash:** $35-58k is credits; $234-382k is cash (Martal + tradeshows + paid ads + founder-led)
- **Two proven channels:** Google Ads and Founder-Led already delivered results in 2025 - optimizing, not testing
- **Two unproven channels:** Martal (3rd attempt after SDRs/Cleverly) + Tradeshows (eTail 2025 = 0 clients)
- **Tradeshows are tiered investment:** Tier 1 committed $26-31k, Tier 2 expansion $7.75-11.25k (test new shows/verticals), Tier 3 opportunistic $7-15k
- **Tradeshows acknowledge risk:** 6 shows total, acknowledge 0 clients is possible (like eTail 2025), but more shows = more at-bats
- **Highest ROI = systematizing what already works:** Founder-Led (100-150x ROI) and Cross-Sells (30-45x ROI)
- **Scalable:** Can adjust programs based on Q1 performance

---

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Q1 2026 Execution (Make or Break)

**Why Q1 is Critical:**
- **Jerome's Furniture project starts January** ($250-278k over 6 months, ~$42-46k/month billable) ✅ Major revenue driver
- $64k in projects ending (Satechi converting to retainer 4/1, partially offsets)
- $39k contracts expiring (likely renewals: Glenmorangie $18k, Wyze $11.6k, others)
- $3.75k MRR reduction from Great Star Tools (budget cut, retained client with expansion pipeline)
- **Total: Jerome's project offsets headwinds + adds significant project revenue**

**Must-Dos:**
- **Execute Jerome's project successfully** (starts Jan, 6-month delivery, sets Shopify Plus tier credential)
  - Finalize resource plan (overlaps with Great Star Tools Shop-Vac; team has bandwidth process in place)
  - Set up project governance and timeline milestones
- Renew all expiring contracts (especially Glenmorangie $18k, Wyze $11.6k)
- Convert month-to-month to terms (4 clients at risk)
- Close 7-9 new recurring clients (aggressive target for founder-led + Martal + paid ads)
- Launch all growth programs (cross-sell, referral, reviews)
- **Secure Great Star Tools Shop-Vac project** ($19-23k Q1-Q2 billable) + map 2026 brand roadmap

**If Q1 fails:**
- Start Q2 at $220-245k MRR accrued (vs. target $260-280k)
- Need to make up $20-30k/month extra in Q2-Q4
- May not hit year-end target
- **Note:** Great Star Tools MRR reduction is manageable if Shop-Vac project books; becomes critical only if project delays

---

### 2. Churn Reduction from 37% to 20%

**Current State:** Losing 37% of retainer clients annually (40% across all clients incl. projects/ad-hoc)
**Target:** 20% retainer churn (still above industry 15%)
**Impact:** Saving $39k MRR annually

**Required Initiatives:**
- Quarterly Business Reviews for $10k+ clients
- 90-day renewal outreach
- Minimum 6-month terms for new clients
- Client health monitoring system
- Early intervention for at-risk accounts

**Investment:** Primarily time/process (minimal cost)

---

### 3. Shopify Plus Partner Status - CRITICAL for 2026

**Current Status:** ⚠️ **AT RISK** - Only 1 Plus migration in past 2 years (BuildDirect 2023)

**Why This Matters:**
- 61% of MRR ($178k/month) comes from Shopify/Plus merchants
- Partner badge drives inbound leads, credibility, and co-marketing opportunities
- Access to Shopify partner referrals and priority support
- **Without Premier+ status:** Lose competitive edge and inbound flow in 2027+

---

#### Shopify Partner Tier Requirements (All 3 Criteria Must Be Met)

| Tier | Merchant Revenue | Plus Referrals (2yr) | People/Skills | Target |
|------|------------------|---------------------|---------------|--------|
| **Premier** | $2M-$10M | **4 Plus** or 40 Standard | 10 people / **30 certifications** | 🎯 **2026 Goal** |
| **Platinum** | $5M-$25M | **6 Plus** | 25 people / 80 certifications | ⭐ Stretch (not feasible) |

---

#### DYODE Assessment Against Each Criterion

**Criterion 1: Merchant Revenue** ✅ **EXCEEDS**
- Current: $200M-$1B+ estimated (15-20 Plus clients at $10-75M GMV each)
- Requirement: Premier $2-10M, Platinum $5-25M+
- **Status: ✅ No action needed - exceeds both tiers**

**Criterion 2: Plus Referrals (Migrations)** ⚠️ **PRIMARY CONSTRAINT**
- Premier requirement: 4 Plus migrations (2-year rolling)
- Platinum requirement: 6 Plus migrations (2-year rolling)
- Current (2024-2025): **Only 1** (BuildDirect in 2023, rolling off soon)
- **Gap: Need 3+ migrations in 2026 for Premier, 5+ for Platinum**
- Historical: 2024 = 0 migrations ❌ | 2025 = 0 migrations ❌
- **Status: ⚠️ URGENT PRIORITY - Need 4x increase from recent performance**

**Criterion 3: People/Skills (Staff + Certifications)** ✅ **ACHIEVABLE**
- Premier requirement: 10 people / 30 Shopify certifications
- Platinum requirement: 25 people / 80 Shopify certifications
- Current staff: 15-18 people ✅ (meets Premier, below Platinum)
- Current certifications: **12 completed + 16 in-progress = 28 potential**
  - ✅ Completed: 12 (Development: 6, Liquid: 3, Selling: 1, Positioning: 2)
  - ⚠️ In-Progress: 16 (assigned but not completed)
- **Gap: Need 2-4 additional certifications beyond in-progress to reach 30**
- **Status: ✅ Achievable - just complete in-progress courses + 2-4 more**

---

#### 2026 Strategy: Target Premier Tier (4 Plus Migrations)

**Why Premier (not Platinum):**
- ✅ Staff count meets Premier (15-18), doesn't meet Platinum (needs 25+)
- ✅ Certifications achievable for Premier (need 2-4 more), not for Platinum (needs 52+ more)
- ✅ 4 migrations challenging but achievable vs. 6 migrations (very difficult - 6x recent performance)

**Quarterly Migration Targets:**

| Quarter | Target | Cumulative | Milestone | Project Revenue |
|---------|--------|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| Q1 2026 | 1 migration (Jerome's) | 1 | Foundation | **$250-278k** |
| Q2 2026 | 1 migration (Bolle or Martal) | 2 | 50% to Premier | $100-150k |
| Q3 2026 | 1-2 migrations (Martal/Founder) | 3-4 | 🎯 **Premier Achieved** | $75-150k |
| Q4 2026 | 0-2 migrations | 4-6 | Stretch to Platinum | $0-150k |
| **TOTAL** | **4-6 migrations** | **4-6** | **Premier/Platinum** | **$525-728k** |

*Note: Jerome's Furniture ($250-278k) runs Jan-Jun 2026 (6 months), with billable revenue spanning Q1-Q2 (~$42-46k/month). Total project revenue includes full contract value.*

**Current Pipeline:**

*Plus Migrations (count toward 4+ Premier requirement):*
- **Jerome's Furniture: $250-278k** (Revised Dec 2025)
  - **Status:** Contract signing expected December 2025, project start January 2026 (6 months)
  - Revised from original $360-390k proposal (March 2025) due to client descoping ERP/data migration in-house
  - **Confidence: ✅ HIGH** (executive review pending, but very likely to close in December)
  - **Plus migration credit:** YES, counts toward 4+ Premier requirement
  - **Team capacity:** Can overlap with Great Star Tools Shop-Vac project; team has process to evaluate bandwidth and hire as needed
- Bolle Brands: ~$100-150k (Q2, no recent communication) 🔴 Low confidence
  - Status: Stopped responding; may be Q4 busy season or lost interest
  - Could re-engage in Q1 2026 if they circle back

*Advanced Migrations (don't count toward Plus requirement but valuable revenue):*
- Instinct Pet Foods: $50k (Q1-Q2, WordPress → Shopify Advanced) ✅ Confirmed
  - Note: Currently wholesale-only; could become Plus candidate if they launch online like Great Star Tools

*Migration Gap:*
- **Need 3+ Plus migrations minimum** to hit 4+ Premier requirement by Q3 2026 (Jerome's counts as 1)
- Martal should be targeting Plus-specific prospects (unproven, but intent is there)

**Migration Sources to Hit 4 Closes (Jerome's confirmed, need 3 more):**
- Current pipeline (Jerome's): 1 confirmed (signing Dec, starting Jan) ✅
- Bolle Brands: 0-1 close (Q2, low confidence - no recent communication) 🔴
- **Martal migration SQLs (10-12 opps):** 2-3 expected closes (35% close rate) **← UNPROVEN but critical**
- Founder outreach (3-4 opps): 1-2 close (need 1-2 if Bolle doesn't close)
- Shopify referrals (2-3 opps): 0-1 close

**Risk:** Jerome's is locked in, but Bolle is silent. Need Martal + founder outreach to reliably hit 4-migration goal. Martal is unproven after 2 failed lead gen attempts (SDRs, Cleverly). If Bolle doesn't re-engage AND Martal fails, hitting 4 migrations becomes very difficult.

**Platform Targeting Priority:**
1. BigCommerce → Shopify Plus (easiest conversion)
2. Magento/Adobe Commerce → Shopify Plus (strong ROI case)
3. WooCommerce → Shopify Plus (performance issues at scale)
4. Custom platforms → Shopify Plus (modernization play)

---

#### Certification Action Plan (To Meet Premier 30-Certification Requirement)

**Q1 2026 (Jan-Mar) - Complete In-Progress:**
- [ ] Push team to complete 16 in-progress certifications
  - Priority: 5 remaining Liquid Storefronts (dev team)
  - Priority: 4 remaining Selling Fundamentals (PM/sales team)
  - Priority: 7 marketing and planning certifications
- [ ] Allocate 4-6 hours/person to complete already-assigned courses
- **Target: 22-25 total certifications by end Q1** (12 current + 10-13 from in-progress)

**Q2 2026 (Apr-Jun) - Final Push to 30:**
- [ ] Complete remaining in-progress certifications (3-6)
- [ ] Co-founders complete Shopify Plus Merchant (2 certifications)
- [ ] Directors complete missing certifications (2-3 certifications)
- [ ] Submit certification proof to Shopify for Premier tier review
- **Target: 30+ certifications by June 30** ✅ (meet Premier threshold)

**Cost & Time Investment:**
- **Cost:** $0 (Shopify certifications are free for partners)
- **Time:** ~64-96 hours total across team in Q1-Q2
- **ROI:** Partner status preservation = competitive advantage + inbound leads

---

#### Success Metrics - Both Referrals AND Certifications Required

**To maintain Premier tier in 2026, DYODE must achieve BOTH:**

| Criterion | Requirement | Current | Q1 Target | Q2 Target | Q3 Target | Status |
|-----------|-------------|---------|-----------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **Plus Referrals** | 4 (2yr) | 1 | 1 closed | 3 cumulative | 4+ cumulative ✅ | ⚠️ **PRIMARY RISK** |
| **Certifications** | 30 | 12 | 22-25 | 30+ ✅ | 30+ | ✅ **ACHIEVABLE** |

**Critical Insight:** Even if we hit 4 Plus migrations, we can still lose Premier tier if we don't reach 30 certifications by June 30, 2026.

**Q1 2026 Action Items:**
- [ ] **Week 1:** Re-engage Jerome's Furniture (migration opportunity, on hold)
- [ ] **Week 1:** Schedule Bolle Brands check-in (4-brand migration, Q2 target)
- [ ] **Week 1:** Schedule Great Star Tools strategy call (Shop-Vac project, brand roadmap, expansion timeline)
- [ ] **Week 1-2:** Push team to complete 16 in-progress Shopify certifications
- [ ] **Week 3:** Review Martal November performance - verify migration SQL delivery
- [ ] **Monthly:** Track migration pipeline and certification progress

**Confirmed Pipeline for Q1-Q2 2026:**
- **Instinct Pet Foods - WordPress → Shopify Advanced:** $50k (4-6 month project, kicking off January 2026) - Quote provided, timeline Q1-Q2
- **Great Star Tools - Shop-Vac:** $19-23k (Q1-Q2 billable project) - Quote already provided, expect confirmation by end Jan 2026
- **Jerome's Furniture:** ~$75k (Plus migration, on hold due to tariffs, follow up in Jan)
- **Bolle Brands:** ~$100-150k (Plus migration, low communication, follow up for Q2 commitment)

**Tracking:** Quarterly reporting to co-founders on both migration pipeline and certification completion progress.

## Financial Projections & Scenarios

### Conservative Scenario (Martal Underperforms)

**Assumptions:**
- Martal delivers 3-4 closes/quarter (below expectations but still working)
- Paid Ads (Google/LinkedIn/Meta): 6-8 clients (conservative end of range, ad groups underperform, CPL stays $1,200-1,300)
- Referrals: 5 converts
- Cross-sells: 6 converts
- Founder-Led: 3-4 converts
- Retainer churn stays at 30% (minimal improvement)

**Outcome:**
- End 2026 MRR: $340-360k (accrued)
- 2026 Revenue: $3.8-4.0M (accrued)
- **Miss target by $200-400k**

**Note:** This scenario assumes Martal underperforms AND paid ads don't optimize significantly (CPL stays at $1,200-1,300 instead of improving to $800-1,000). But even in conservative case, Paid Ads still delivers 6-9 clients from proven channel.

---

### Base Case Scenario (Our Plan - Martal Performs)

**Assumptions:**
- Martal delivers 8-10 closes (as hoped, but unproven after 2 failed attempts)
- Paid Ads (Google/LinkedIn/Meta): 9-12 clients (mid-range, ad groups show promise, CPL ~$1,000-1,100)
- Referrals: 5-8 converts
- Cross-sells: 6-8 converts
- Founder-Led: 4-6 converts
- Retainer churn reduces to 25%

**Outcome:**
- End 2026 MRR: $365-381k accrued
- 2026 Revenue: $4.0-4.2M accrued
- **Hit target** (heavily driven by Paid Ads + Martal + referrals/cross-sells)

**Risk:** Depends heavily on Martal working. Paid Ads already proven (delivered 4 clients in 2025 at $1,310 CPL); 2026 focus is on identifying which ad group (migrations, CRO, site speed) converts best, not dramatically reducing CPL. Scaling with realistic $1,000-1,100 CPL is achievable.

**Great Star Tools Impact:** MRR loss of $3.75k/mo is offset by confirmed Shop-Vac project ($19-23k Q1-Q2) + future brand additions. This is NOT a churn risk but a budget-constrained retention with major expansion runway.

---

### Aggressive Scenario (Martal Exceeds + Everything Works)

**Assumptions:**
- Martal delivers 10-12 closes (best case, given 2 prior failures - unlikely)
- Paid Ads (Google/LinkedIn/Meta): 13-15 clients (successful ad group targeting, migrations/CRO ad groups outperform, CPL stays $1,000-1,100)
- Referrals: 8-10 converts
- Cross-sells: 8-10 converts
- Founder-Led: 6 converts
- Retainer churn reduces to 20% (industry benchmark)

**Outcome:**
- End 2026 MRR: $390-415k accrued
- 2026 Revenue: $4.3-4.6M accrued
- **Beat target by $100-400k**

**Risk:** Very optimistic. Requires Martal to outperform AND paid ads' best-performing ad groups (likely migrations or CRO) to significantly outweigh underperformers AND all other channels to hit high end. CPL stays $1,000-1,100, but volume and conversion rates improve.

**Note on Great Star Tools:** While they have potential to add more brands beyond Shop-Vac (100+ brands in portfolio), given their 2025 financial performance, we're conservatively forecasting only Shop-Vac for 2026. Additional brand migrations would be upside, not baseline expectations.

---

## Key Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Martal Underperforms

**Probability:** Medium (40%)
**Impact:** High ($300-400k revenue miss)

**Mitigation:**
- Monthly performance reviews with Martal
- Referral program compensates (5-8 clients = same impact)
- Increase founder-led outreach
- Have backup lead gen options ready

**Contingency:** If Martal shows poor ROI by March, pivot budget to in-house sales hire

---

### Risk 2: Q1 Revenue Crater

**Probability:** Medium-Low (25%) ✅ **REDUCED** (was 35%)
**Impact:** Very High (sets back entire year)

**Recent Improvements:**
- ✅ Poseidon Bikes renewed 12 months (10/28/25) - $8,625 secured
- ✅ Align Tech renewed 6 months (9/25/25) - $8,625 secured
- ✅ Satechi converting to retainer 4/1/26 - $6,250 secured
- ✅ Great Star Tools renewed 12 months (11/25) - Dev hours reduced $7.5k → $3.75k, Marketing stable $8.5k (see expansion opportunity below)
- **$23k MRR risk removed** since original assessment

**Great Star Tools Context - NOT A CHURN RISK:**
- **Why hours reduced:** Finance department mandated expense cuts (Amazon sales down, wholesale orders down - external factors)
- **Quality signal:** Client explicitly praised DYODE's website launch and digital marketing work
- **Expansion opportunity:** Website launched with 2 brands (Primeline Parts, Arrow Fastener); plan to add 98+ more brands in 2026, starting with Shop-Vac
- **Pipeline:** Shop-Vac brand migration already quoted at $19-23k (expect Q1-Q2 2026 billable)
- **Long-term runway:** Each brand addition = $15-25k project + ongoing retainer potential
- **MRR impact:** $3.75k reduction in Jan, but offset by Shop-Vac project + multi-brand expansion pipeline

**Remaining Mitigation:**
- Aggressive renewal outreach for Dec expirations (Glenmorangie, Wyze, Kindred, Beach Riot)
- Personal calls to 4 remaining month-to-month clients
- Front-load new client acquisition in Jan
- **Schedule Q1 Great Star Tools strategy call** to map 2026 brand roadmap and confirm Shop-Vac timeline

**Contingency:** Accept lower Q1 MRR, make up in Q2-Q4

---

### Risk 3: Cross-Sell/Referral Programs Fail to Launch

**Probability:** Low-Medium (25%)
**Impact:** Medium ($90-150k revenue miss)

**Mitigation:**
- Coordinated rollout with training
- Meaningful incentives for AMs
- Personal outreach vs. email blasts
- Share early wins to build momentum

**Contingency:** Increase Martal budget or founder-led effort

---

### Risk 4: Churn Stays High (37%+ retainer / 40% all clients incl. projects)

**Probability:** Medium (40%)
**Impact:** High (need $39k more new business)

**Mitigation:**
- Implement QBR process immediately
- Proactive account management
- Client health monitoring
- Focus on high-value client retention

**Contingency:** Accept lower net growth target

---

## Strategic Decisions Needed

### Decision 1: Program Approvals

**What:** Approve all three incentive programs (cross-sell, referral, review)
**Investment:** $35-58k (mostly credits, performance-based)
**Timeline:** Decide by Dec 2 to launch internally Dec 9

**Recommendation:** APPROVE
- Lowest-risk growth channels
- Performance-based (only pay for results)
- Highest ROI programs (10-45x)

---

### Decision 2: Martal Renewal (Post-Pilot)

**What:** Renew Martal for Q2-Q4 or pivot to different approach
**Investment:** $54k (3 more quarters)
**Timeline:** Decide by end of Jan 2026 based on pilot results

**Criteria for Renewal:**
- Minimum 4 closes from pilot
- SQL quality meeting expectations
- ROI positive (>3x)

**Recommendation:** CONDITIONAL APPROVE
- Evaluate after pilot
- If underperforming, pivot to in-house sales hire

---

### Decision 3: Sales Team Hiring

**What:** Hire dedicated Sales Executive (alternative to Martal)
**Investment:** $120-150k/year (base + commission)
**Timeline:** Q2 2026 if Martal doesn't renew

**Recommendation:** WAIT
- See Martal results first
- Referral program may reduce need
- If needed, hire in Q2/Q3

---

### Decision 4: Churn Reduction Investment

**What:** Dedicate resources to retention (QBRs, health monitoring, processes)
**Investment:** Primarily time (minimal cash)
**Timeline:** Start immediately (Dec 2025)

**Recommendation:** APPROVE IMMEDIATELY
- Highest ROI activity (saving $39k MRR)
- Low cost, high impact
- Should have started 2 years ago

---

## The Path Forward: Three Scenarios

### Scenario A: "All In" (Recommended)

**Approach:**
- Approve all 7 growth programs immediately
- Aggressive Q1 execution
- Renew Martal if pilot succeeds
- Systematize multi-channel paid ads and Founder-Led (Google already proven, LinkedIn/Meta new)
- Invest heavily in retention
- Test 6 tradeshows across 3 tiers (committed, expansion, opportunistic)

**Investment:** $269-430.5k
- Includes: Martal ($72k), Referrals ($20-35k), Cross-sells ($10-16k), Reviews ($5-7.5k), Tradeshows ($40-65k), Paid Ads ($120-240k), Founder-Led ($2-5k)

**Upside:** $4.0-4.2M accrued revenue (hit target)

**Risk:** Medium-Low (diversified approach, 2 proven channels: Google Ads + Founder-Led)

**Our Recommendation:** This is the right strategy. 7 channels reduce risk, 2 channels already proven (Google Ads, Founder-Led), highest ROI programs prioritized (Founder-Led 100x, Cross-Sells 30x), most programs are performance-based, and paid ads/tradeshows are tiered for flexibility.

---

### Scenario B: "Conservative"

**Approach:**
- Launch referral/review only (skip cross-sell)
- See Martal results before investing more
- Focus on retention over acquisition
- Attend Tier 1 tradeshows only (eTail West, CES, ShopTalk) - skip expansion shows
- Continue Google Ads at current level + Founder-Led (already working)

**Investment:** $145-212.5k
- Includes: Martal ($18k Q1 pilot only), Referrals ($20-35k), Reviews ($5-7.5k), Tradeshows ($26-31k Tier 1 only), Google Ads ($72k maintain), Founder-Led ($2-5k), LinkedIn/Meta testing ($24k)
- Skips: Cross-sells, Google Ads scale-up, Tier 2/3 tradeshows

**Upside:** $3.85-4.05M accrued revenue (miss target by $150-250k)

**Risk:** Low cash risk, but likely miss target

**Not Recommended:** Playing not to lose instead of playing to win. Skipping cross-sells leaves money on table (30-45x ROI). Missing expansion tradeshow opportunities.

---

### Scenario C: "Double Down on Martal"

**Approach:**
- Renew Martal regardless of pilot results
- Skip referral/cross-sell programs
- Scale Martal to 2x volume
- Attend all tradeshows (Tier 1 + 2 + 3)
- Scale paid ads to Phase 2 levels

**Investment:** $258-334k
- Includes: Martal 2x ($144k), Tradeshows ($40-65k), Paid Ads Phase 2 ($120-240k), Founder-Led ($2-5k)
- Skips: Referrals, Cross-sells, Reviews (highest ROI programs)

**Upside:** $4.15-4.45M accrued revenue if Martal performs

**Risk:** Very High (betting heavily on unproven channel after 2 failures)

**Not Recommended:** Too risky. If Martal fails (50% chance given 2 prior failures), we have limited backup. Skipping cross-sells (30-45x ROI) and referrals (10-15x ROI) to double down on unproven channel is poor strategy.

---

## Bottom Line Recommendation

### What We Should Do:

✅ **Systematize what already works** (Founder-Led + Google Ads optimization)
- Investment: $74-125k
- ROI: 2-150x (Founder-Led 100-150x, Google Ads 2-3x after optimization)
- Status: PROVEN in 2025 - delivered 7 clients/opportunities

✅ **Launch high-ROI client programs** (cross-sell, referral, review)
- Investment: $35-58k (mostly credits, performance-based)
- ROI: 10-45x across programs
- Timeline: Launch Dec-Jan

✅ **Invest in brand presence** (tradeshows - tiered approach)
- Investment: $40-65k (Tier 1 committed $26-31k, Tier 2 expansion $7.75-11.25k, Tier 3 opportunistic $7-15k)
- ROI: 0-7x + long-term brand building
- Timeline: CES (Jan), eTail West (Feb), ShopTalk (Mar), Expo West (Mar), Commerce Next (Jun), ShopTalk Fall (Sep)

✅ **Renew Martal conditionally** (if 4+ closes from pilot by Jan 31)
- Investment: $54k (Q2-Q4) - only if pilot succeeds
- ROI: 7-8x if performing
- Status: UNPROVEN - 3rd attempt after 2 failures

✅ **Invest heavily in retention** (QBRs, processes)
- Investment: Minimal (mostly time)
- ROI: 30-40x (saving $39k MRR)

✅ **Execute aggressively in Q1**
- This quarter sets the tone for the year
- Front-load effort, personally involved
- Block 2 hours/week for founder-led outreach

**Total Investment:** $269-430.5k for $4.2M accrued revenue target
**Expected ROI:** 6-9x overall (mix of proven and new channels)

---

### What Success Looks Like:

**End of Q1 (March 31, 2026):**
- MRR: $260k accrued (vs. $280k aggressive target)
- New clients: 7-9 closed
- Cross-sells: 1-2 in progress
- Referrals: 2-3 in pipeline
- Reviews: 5-8 submitted

**End of 2026 (December 31, 2026):**
- MRR: $365-381k accrued (target hit)
- Revenue: $4.0-4.2M accrued
- Churn: 25% retainer (down from 37%)
- Active clients: 43-48 (up from 30)
- Multiple growth channels firing

---

### What Failure Looks Like:

**If we don't execute:**
- Continue decline trajectory
- End 2026 at $2.8-3.0M revenue (accrued)
- MRR drops to $220-240k (accrued)
- Cash flow increasingly tight (AR issues compound)
- Team morale suffers
- Harder to recruit/retain talent
- May need to consider harder decisions (layoffs, pivots)

## The Ask

**Immediate Decisions Needed (By Dec 2):**

1. **Approve cross-sell commission program?** (5% of contract value)
2. **Approve referral credit program?** (5-10% tiered structure)
3. **Approve review credit program?** ($500/review)
4. **Approve tradeshow budget?** ($40-65k across 6 shows: Tier 1 committed $26-31k [eTail/CES/ShopTalk], Tier 2 expansion $7.75-11.25k [Expo West/Commerce Next/ShopTalk Fall], Tier 3 opportunistic $7-15k)
5. **Approve multi-channel paid ads budget?** ($120-240k: Google $72-120k + LinkedIn $36-72k + Meta $12-48k)
6. **Commit to founder-led systematization?** (Block 2 hours/week, $2-5k for tools)
7. **Budget allocation approved?** ($269-430.5k total investment)
8. **Timeline approved?** (Dec internal launch → Jan soft launch → Feb full launch)

**Post-Pilot Decision (By Jan 31):**

9. **Renew Martal for Q2-Q4?** (Based on pilot results - need 4+ closes, $54k investment)

## Final Thoughts

**We're at an inflection point.**

Three years of decline has brought us to $3.6M from a $4.88M peak. The trajectory slowed in 2025 (from -20% to -6.5%), but we're still declining. Another year of similar decline puts us at $3.2-3.3M and increasingly difficult questions.

**But we have a plan.**

This isn't a Hail Mary. It's a 7-channel, data-driven strategy that:
- **Doubles down on what already works:** Google Ads and Founder-Led delivered 7 clients/opportunities in 2025
- **Adds high-ROI programs:** Cross-sells (30-45x) and referrals (10-15x) leverage existing clients
- **Builds long-term brand:** Tradeshows position us as established player
- **Tests one unproven channel:** Martal (but only renew if pilot succeeds)
- **Built-in redundancy:** If Martal fails (like SDRs/Cleverly), 6 other channels compensate

**The key is execution.**

We can't half-ass this. Q1 sets the tone. If we execute with urgency and focus, we can reverse the trend and get back on a growth trajectory.

**The alternative is unacceptable.**

Let's make 2026 the turnaround year.
