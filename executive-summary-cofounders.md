## The Bottom Line

**2025 Reality Check:**
- Current MRR: **$292,946** (down from $350k+ peak)
- Projected 2025 Revenue: **$3.1-3.2M** (down 20% YoY)
- 3-Year Decline: **Down 34% from $4.86M peak (2022)**
- Churn Rate: **35-40%** (2x industry benchmark)

**2026 Ambition:**
- Target MRR: **$381,496** (46% growth needed)
- Target Revenue: **$4.2M**
- Strategic Imperative: **Reverse 3-year decline or face continued erosion**

**The Challenge:** We need to add **$209k in new MRR** while fighting **35% churn** in a market with frozen client budgets and increasing competition.

**The Strategy:** Multi-channel growth approach combining new client acquisition, cross-selling, referrals, and churn reduction.

## 2025: What Happened

### The Decline Accelerated

| Year | Revenue | YoY Change |
|------|---------|------------|
| 2022 | $4.86M | Peak |
| 2023 | $4.71M | -3% (manageable) |
| 2024 | $4.00M | -15% (concerning) |
| 2025 | $3.2M | **-20% (critical)** |

**Root Causes:**
1. **Unsustainable churn:** 35-40% vs. 15-20% industry average
2. **No systematic lead generation** until Nov 2025 (Martal launch)
3. **Too many month-to-month contracts:** 24% of MRR has no commitment
4. **High project dependency:** 26% of revenue ends naturally
5. **Economic headwinds:** Client budget freezes, tariffs, inflation

### Current Client Base (November 2025)

**Active Clients:** 30 unique clients (58 service engagements)
- Development: 61% of MRR ($179k)
- Marketing: 29% of MRR ($84k)
- Consulting: 6% of MRR ($19k)
- Ad-Hoc: 4% of MRR ($12k)

**Critical Issues:**
- **$147k MRR at high risk** (52% of total):
  - $64k projects ending Q1
  - $67k month-to-month (no contract protection)
  - $19k client reductions likely (Glenmorangie, Wyze)

**2025 Churn Analysis:**
- Clients added: 13 unique clients
- Clients lost: 22 unique clients
- **Net: -9 clients**
- Churn by service: Dev 44%, Marketing 56%, Consulting 60%

### What We Did Right

1. **Launched Martal partnership** (Nov 2025)
   - 18 guaranteed SQLs over 3 months
   - First systematic lead gen effort

2. **Maintained key client relationships**
   - AG Jeans, Great Star Tools, Glenmorangie still active
   - Some clients renewed despite market conditions

3. **Stabilized Q3-Q4**
   - MRR held around $290k vs. continued decline

### What We Didn't Do (But Need To)

1. ❌ Systematic client retention process (QBRs, renewal outreach)
2. ❌ Leverage existing clients for cross-sells and referrals
3. ❌ Build social proof (Clutch reviews)
4. ❌ Enforce minimum contract terms (too many month-to-month)
5. ❌ Diversify lead sources beyond organic

---

## 2026 Strategy: Multi-Channel Growth Approach

### The Math

**Starting Point (Adjusted for Q4 losses):** ~$260-273k MRR
**Target End 2026:** $381k MRR
**Net Growth Needed:** $108-121k MRR
**Accounting for Churn:** ~$112k expected losses
**Total New Business Required:** **$209-220k MRR**

**This means:** We need to replace 100% of churned clients PLUS add 46% net growth.

---

### Revenue Channels: Diversified Portfolio Approach

| Channel | Contribution | Close Rate | CAC | Investment |
|---------|--------------|------------|-----|------------|
| **Martal Lead Gen** | 8-10 clients ($60-75k MRR) | 30-40% | $5-7k | Ongoing ($18k/quarter) |
| **Client Referrals** | 5-8 clients ($37-60k MRR) | 60-80% | $500-2k | $20-35k (credits) |
| **Cross-Sells** | 6-8 expansions ($40-58k MRR) | 30-40% | $1-2k | $10-16k (commissions) |
| **Founder-led** | 6-8 clients ($45-60k MRR) | 35-45% | $1-3k | Time/effort |
| **Inbound (Clutch)** | 2-3 clients ($15-22k MRR) | 40-50% | $2-4k | $5-7.5k (review credits) |
| **TOTAL** | **27-37 additions** | **~35% avg** | **~$3k avg** | **$53-76.5k** |

**Strategic Rationale:**
- **No single point of failure:** If Martal underperforms, referrals and cross-sells compensate
- **Optimized CAC:** Referrals and cross-sells bring down blended CAC significantly
- **Quality over volume:** Referrals = better fit, higher retention
- **Leverage existing assets:** 30 active clients are underutilized for growth

---

## The Four Growth Programs

### 1. Cross-Sell Incentive Program (Internal)

**Opportunity:**
- 27 of 30 clients (90%) use only ONE service
- ~20-21 viable targets after excluding past failures

**Program:**
- Account managers earn 5% of contract term value
- Example: $7,500/month x 6-month contract = $2,250 commission
- Alternative to raises during salary freeze

**Targets:**
- 6-8 cross-sells in 2026
- $40-58k new MRR
- Investment: $10-16k in commissions
- ROI: 30-45x

**Key Constraints:**
- Some clients already tried/failed other services (United Scope, Wyze, Tori Richard)
- Budget freezes (Pair of Thieves)
- Enterprise barriers (Glenmorangie - LVMH owned)

**Decision Needed:** Approve commission structure and timing

---

### 2. Client Referral Program (External)

**Opportunity:**
- Referrals have 60-80% close rate vs. 30-40% other channels
- Clients are well-connected in eCommerce space
- Lowest CAC channel

**Program:**
- Clients earn 5-10% of first contract value in service credits
- Tiered based on deal size ($15k = 5%, $75k+ = 10%)
- Credits apply to future invoices (not cash)

**Targets:**
- 5-8 referrals converting to deals
- $250-400k revenue
- Investment: $20-35k in credits
- ROI: 10-15x

**Risk Mitigation:**
- 60-day clawback if referred client churns
- ICP targeting (Shopify Plus, $10M+)
- Credit-based (keeps clients engaged vs. cash)

**Decision Needed:** Approve credit structure and budget

---

### 3. Clutch Review Incentive (External)

**Opportunity:**
- Clutch reviews drive 30-40% of inbound agency leads
- Currently under-leveraged (need more reviews)
- Social proof critical for Shopify Plus prospects

**Program:**
- $500 service credit per qualified review
- Requirements: 4+ stars, 100+ words, specifics

**Targets:**
- 10-15 reviews in 2026
- Investment: $5-7.5k in credits
- ROI: 10-20x (inbound lead impact)

**Decision Needed:** Approve $500 credit amount

---

### 4. Martal Partnership Optimization

**Status:**
- Launched Nov 1, 2025
- 3-month pilot through Jan 2026
- 18 guaranteed SQLs

**Realistic Expectations (Revised Down):**
- Q1 closes: 3-6 clients (not 6-8 originally hoped)
- Sales lag: 30-60 days from SQL to close
- Holiday slowdown in Dec/Jan affects pipeline

**Q1 2026 Decision Point:**
- If 4+ closes: Renew and scale
- If 2-3 closes: Evaluate ROI, may need to adjust
- If <2 closes: Consider alternative lead gen

**Investment:** $18k/quarter (~$72k annually if renewed)

**Decision Needed:** Renewal criteria and budget allocation

---

## Resource Allocation & Investment Summary

### 2026 Growth Investment Breakdown

| Program | Investment | Expected Return | ROI |
|---------|------------|-----------------|-----|
| **Martal** | $72k/year | $480-600k revenue | 7-8x |
| **Referrals** | $20-35k (credits) | $250-400k revenue | 10-15x |
| **Cross-Sells** | $10-16k (commissions) | $480-696k revenue (annualized) | 30-45x |
| **Reviews** | $5-7.5k (credits) | $50-100k revenue (inbound) | 10-20x |
| **TOTAL** | **$107-130.5k** | **$1.26-1.8M revenue** | **12-14x** |

**Budget Considerations:**
- **All programs are performance-based:** Only pay when results happen
- **Credits vs. cash:** $35-58k is credits (lower cash impact)
- **Scalable:** Can adjust based on Q1 performance

---

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Q1 2026 Execution (Make or Break)

**Why Q1 is Critical:**
- $64k in projects ending
- $39k contracts expiring
- $19k client reductions likely
- **Total headwind: ~$77k MRR loss**

**Must-Dos:**
- Renew all expiring contracts
- Convert month-to-month to terms
- Close 7-9 new clients (aggressive)
- Launch all growth programs

**If Q1 fails:**
- Start Q2 at $220-245k MRR (vs. target $260-280k)
- Need to make up $20-30k/month extra in Q2-Q4
- May not hit year-end target

---

### 2. Churn Reduction from 35% to 20%

**Current State:** Losing 35-40% of clients annually
**Target:** 20% (still above industry 15%)
**Impact:** Saving $39k MRR annually

**Required Initiatives:**
- Quarterly Business Reviews for $10k+ clients
- 90-day renewal outreach
- Minimum 6-month terms for new clients
- Client health monitoring system
- Early intervention for at-risk accounts

**Investment:** Primarily time/process (minimal cost)

---

### 3. Shopify Plus Partner Status

**Current Status:** At risk (only 2 Plus projects in 2 years)
**Requirement:** 4-6 Shopify Plus projects/year for Premium/Platinum
**Why Critical:** Badge drives inbound leads and credibility

**Strategy:**
- Prioritize Shopify Plus prospects with Martal
- Leverage referrals to target Plus brands
- Partner with Shopify sales team

**Tracking:** Must monitor Plus closes quarterly

---

**Contingency:** If Martal shows poor ROI by March, pivot budget to in-house sales hire

---

### Risk 2: Q1 Revenue Crater

**Probability:** Medium (35%)
**Impact:** Very High (sets back entire year)

**Mitigation:**
- Aggressive renewal outreach NOW (Dec)
- Personal calls to all expiring contracts
- Incentivize renewals (discount, additional services)
- Front-load new client acquisition in Jan

**Contingency:** Accept lower Q1 MRR, make up in Q2-Q4

---

### Risk 3: Cross-Sell/Referral Programs Fail to Launch

**Probability:** Low-Medium (25%)
**Impact:** Medium ($90-150k revenue miss)

**Mitigation:**
- Coordinated rollout with training
- Meaningful incentives for AMs
- Personal outreach vs. email blasts
- Share early wins to build momentum

**Contingency:** Increase Martal budget or founder-led effort

---

### Risk 4: Churn Stays High (35%+)

- Focus on high-value client retention

**Contingency:** Accept lower net growth target

---

## Strategic Decisions Needed

### Decision 1: Program Approvals

**What:** Approve all three incentive programs (cross-sell, referral, review)

**Timeline:** Decide by Dec 2 to launch internally Dec 9

**Recommendation:** APPROVE
- Lowest-risk growth channels
- Performance-based (only pay for results)
- Highest ROI programs (10-45x)

---

### Decision 2: Martal Renewal (Post-Pilot)

**What:** Renew Martal for Q2-Q4 or pivot to different approach
**Investment:** $54k (3 more quarters)

**Recommendation:** WAIT
- See Martal results first
- Referral program may reduce need
- If needed, hire in Q2/Q3

---

### Decision 4: Churn Reduction Investment

**What:** Dedicate resources to retention (QBRs, health monitoring, processes)
**Investment:** Primarily time (minimal cash)
**Timeline:** Start immediately (Dec 2025)

**Recommendation:** APPROVE IMMEDIATELY

## The Path Forward: Three Scenarios

### Scenario A: "All In" (Recommended)

**Approach:**
- Approve all growth programs immediately
- Aggressive Q1 execution
- Renew Martal if pilot succeeds
- Invest heavily in retention

**Investment:** $107-130k
**Upside:** $4.0-4.2M revenue (hit target)
**Risk:** Medium (diversified approach)

**Our Recommendation:** This is the right strategy. Multiple channels reduce risk, and all programs are performance-based.

---

### Scenario B: "Conservative"

**Approach:**
- Launch referral/review only (skip cross-sell)
- See Martal results before investing more
- Focus on retention over acquisition

**Investment:** $45-60k
**Upside:** $3.7-3.9M revenue (miss target by $200-300k)
**Risk:** Low, but guarantees we miss target

**Not Recommended:** Playing not to lose instead of playing to win.

---

### Scenario C: "Double Down on Martal"

**Approach:**
- Renew Martal regardless of pilot results
- Skip referral/cross-sell programs
- Scale Martal to 2x volume

**Investment:** $140-160k (all Martal)
**Upside:** $4.0-4.3M if Martal performs
**Risk:** Very High (single point of failure)

**Not Recommended:** Too risky. If Martal fails, we have no backup.

---

## Bottom Line Recommendation

### What We Should Do:

✅ **Approve all three growth programs** (cross-sell, referral, review)
- Investment: $35-58k (mostly credits)
- ROI: 10-45x across programs
- Timeline: Launch Dec-Jan

✅ **Renew Martal conditionally** (if 4+ closes from pilot)
- Investment: $54k (Q2-Q4)
- ROI: 7-8x if performing

✅ **Invest heavily in retention** (QBRs, processes)
- Investment: Minimal (mostly time)
- ROI: 30-40x (saving $39k MRR)

✅ **Execute aggressively in Q1**
- This quarter sets the tone for the year
- Front-load effort, personally involved

**Total Investment:** $107-130k for $4.2M revenue target
**Expected ROI:** 12-14x overall

---

### What Success Looks Like:

**End of Q1 (March 31, 2026):**
- MRR: $260k (vs. $280k aggressive target)
- New clients: 7-9 closed
- Cross-sells: 1-2 in progress
- Referrals: 2-3 in pipeline
- Reviews: 5-8 submitted

**End of 2026 (December 31, 2026):**
- MRR: $365-381k (target hit)
- Revenue: $4.0-4.2M
- Churn: 25% (down from 35%)
- Active clients: 43-48 (up from 30)
- Multiple growth channels firing

---

### What Failure Looks Like:

**If we don't execute:**
- Continue 20% annual decline
- End 2026 at $2.5-2.7M revenue
- MRR drops to $220-240k
- Team morale suffers
- Harder to recruit/retain talent
- May need to consider harder decisions (layoffs, pivots)

---

## The Ask

**Immediate Decisions Needed (By Dec 2):**

1. **Approve cross-sell commission program?** (5% of contract value)
2. **Approve referral credit program?** (5-10% tiered structure)
3. **Approve review credit program?** ($500/review)
4. **Budget allocation approved?** ($107-130k total investment)
5. **Timeline approved?** (Dec internal launch → Jan soft launch → Feb full launch)

**Post-Pilot Decision (By Jan 31):**

6. **Renew Martal for Q2-Q4?** (Based on pilot results, $54k investment)

---

## Final Thoughts

**We're at an inflection point.**

Three years of decline has brought us to $3.2M from a $4.86M peak. Another year of 20% decline puts us at $2.5M and existential questions.

**But we have a plan.**

This isn't a Hail Mary. It's a diversified, data-driven strategy with built-in redundancy. If one channel underperforms, others compensate. And every program is performance-based — we only pay for results.

**The key is execution.**

We can't half-ass this. Q1 sets the tone. If we execute with urgency and focus, we can reverse the trend and get back on a growth trajectory.

**The alternative is unacceptable.**

Let's make 2026 the turnaround year.
