# Incentive Structure Analysis: Fairness & Role Equity

**Created:** December 2025
**Purpose:** Address fairness concerns about commission opportunities during hiring freeze
**Status:** DRAFT for co-founder review

---

## The Fairness Problem

### Current Situation

**Account Managers can earn $5-15k+ in commissions through:**
- Cross-sell commissions (5% of contract value)
- Referral credits (5-10% of first contract)
- Review credits ($500 each)

**Directors and other roles have no equivalent earning opportunity during salary freeze.**

### Organizational Structure (As We Understand It)

**Client-Facing Roles:**
- **Account Managers (AMs):** Primary client contact, manage day-to-day relationships
- **Director(s) of Account Management:** Oversee AMs, may be involved in strategic client relationships

**Non-Client-Facing Roles:**
- **Director of Web Development:** Manages dev team, occasional client interaction on technical matters
- **Director of Operations:** Internal operations, limited/no client contact
- **Potentially other directors or senior roles**

### The Fairness Questions

1. **Directors of Account Management:**
   - Do they get override commissions when their AMs close deals?
   - If AMs can earn $10k but directors get nothing, is that fair given directors likely earn more base salary but also have more responsibility?

2. **Director of Web Development:**
   - Dev teams often spot cross-sell opportunities (e.g., "this client needs marketing help")
   - Should dev directors get compensated for identifying/enabling cross-sells even if they don't pitch?
   - During client projects, dev directors may have senior-level conversations that surface opportunities

3. **Director of Operations:**
   - No direct client contact
   - Critical to company success but has no path to earn commissions
   - Is this role fundamentally disadvantaged during the freeze?

4. **IC (Individual Contributor) AMs vs. Directors:**
   - Is it acceptable that junior AMs could earn more in total comp (salary + commission) than their directors during the freeze?
   - Does this create resentment or motivation issues?

---

## Key Questions to Answer

### 1. Client Communication Ownership

**Who "owns" the client relationship?**
- Is it the AM exclusively?
- Is it the Director of Account Management for key accounts?
- Is it shared?

**Who should be making the asks (cross-sells, referrals, reviews)?**
- AMs during regular check-ins?
- Directors during QBRs or strategic conversations?
- Collaborative (AM identifies, Director helps close)?

**Current assumption in documents:** AMs own the asks and execution, with service leads (dev/marketing) supporting the pitch.

**Need to clarify:** Where do Directors of Account Management fit?

---

### 2. Tracking and Attribution

**If multiple people contribute, who gets credit?**

**Scenario 1:** Director of Web Dev mentions to a client "you should consider our marketing services" → AM follows up and closes
- Who gets commission?

**Scenario 2:** AM pitches cross-sell → Director of Account Management helps close the deal on a strategic call
- Split commission? Full to AM?

**Scenario 3:** Client proactively asks Director of Account Management about adding a service → Director closes it
- Should Director get commission even if AM wasn't involved?

**Need:** Clear attribution rules and a tracking system (CRM fields?)

---

### 3. Fair Compensation During Hiring Freeze

**The core tension:**
- Salary freeze affects everyone equally (no raises)
- Commission opportunity is NOT equal (only client-facing roles benefit)
- Is this acceptable or does it create morale issues?

**Consider:**
- Directors may already earn 20-40% more in base salary than AMs
- But they also have more responsibility and stress
- During freeze, AMs could potentially out-earn directors in total comp
- Some roles (Ops Director) have zero path to variable comp

---

## Potential Solutions

### Option 1: AM-Only Commissions (Current Plan)

**Structure:**
- Only Account Managers earn commissions on cross-sells, referrals, and reviews
- Directors and other roles: No variable comp during freeze

**Pros:**
- Simple and clear
- AMs do the day-to-day work and should be rewarded
- Similar to sales commission models (sales reps earn commissions, sales directors don't always)

**Cons:**
- Directors feel left out during freeze
- May create resentment ("my team can earn bonuses but I can't")
- Non-client-facing directors completely excluded
- Ignores contributions from directors who enable deals

**Best for:** Companies where AMs truly own relationships and directors are hands-off coaches

---

### Option 2: Override Commissions for Directors of Account Management

**Structure:**
- **AMs:** 5% commission on cross-sells (as planned)
- **Directors of Account Management:** 1-2% override on their team's cross-sells
- **Other directors:** No commissions

**Example:**
- AM cross-sells $7,500/month x 6-month contract = $45,000
- AM earns: $2,250 (5%)
- Director earns: $450-900 (1-2% override)

**Pros:**
- Rewards directors for coaching and enabling their teams
- Aligns incentives (directors want their AMs to succeed)
- Still keeps bulk of commission with the AM doing the work
- Common in sales organizations

**Cons:**
- Adds cost (now paying 6-7% total instead of 5%)
- Directors of Dev and Ops still excluded
- May feel like "double dipping" if director isn't actively involved

**Best for:** If Directors of Account Management are actively coaching AMs on cross-sells and involved in strategic client relationships

---

### Option 3: Company Performance Bonuses for All Directors

**Structure:**
- **AMs:** Individual commissions on cross-sells, referrals, reviews (as planned)
- **All Directors:** Quarterly/annual bonuses tied to company MRR growth targets

**Example Bonus Structure:**
- **Target:** Hit $360k MRR by end of 2026 (+$67k from current $293k)
- **Bonus Pool:** $20-30k split among all directors
- **Triggers:**
  - 50% payout if hit 80% of target (+$53k MRR)
  - 100% payout if hit 100% of target (+$67k MRR)
  - 150% payout if exceed target by 20% (+$80k MRR)

**Per Director (assuming 4 directors):**
- 50% payout: $2,500-3,750 each
- 100% payout: $5,000-7,500 each
- 150% payout: $7,500-11,250 each

**Pros:**
- Everyone shares in company success (fair to all directors)
- Aligns entire leadership team toward same goal
- Doesn't require client-facing work
- Encourages cross-functional collaboration
- Directors of Ops and Dev feel included

**Cons:**
- Less direct connection between effort and reward
- Directors may feel they have less control over outcome
- AMs could still out-earn directors if they hit all individual targets
- Adds cost if both AMs and directors hit goals

**Best for:** Emphasizing team success over individual wins; including all leadership

---

### Option 4: Role-Specific Contribution Opportunities

**Structure:**
- **AMs:** Cross-sell commissions, referral credits, review credits (as planned)
- **Directors of Account Management:** 1-2% override on team cross-sells OR commission on cross-sells they personally close
- **Director of Web Development:** Commission for identifying cross-sell opportunities during project work (if AM successfully closes)
  - Example: Dev Director mentions marketing need to client, logs it in CRM, AM closes → Dev Director gets 1-2% finder's fee
- **Director of Operations:** Bonus tied to retention/churn improvement (operational excellence)
  - Example: If churn reduces from 35% to 25%, Ops Director gets $3-5k bonus
- **Other directors:** Role-appropriate incentives

**Pros:**
- Everyone has a path to earn during freeze
- Incentives align with each role's unique contribution
- Encourages cross-functional support (Dev identifying marketing needs, Ops improving retention)
- Fair and inclusive

**Cons:**
- Complex to track and administer
- Risk of confusion about who gets what
- Potential for disputes over attribution
- Requires sophisticated tracking system

**Best for:** If you want to involve everyone and have capacity to manage complexity

---

### Option 5: Profit Sharing for Directors, Commissions for AMs

**Structure:**
- **AMs:** Individual commissions (as planned)
- **Directors:** Year-end profit sharing based on company profitability

**Example:**
- If 2026 profit margin hits target (or improves by X%), directors split a profit-sharing pool
- Pool could be 2-5% of annual profit
- If profit is $600k and pool is 3% = $18k to split among directors

**Pros:**
- Rewards directors for overall company health (not just revenue growth)
- Simple and clean
- Directors share in success regardless of role
- AMs get immediate gratification (commission within 30 days)
- Directors get larger payout at year-end

**Cons:**
- Long delay (year-end) may feel less motivating
- Profit can be affected by factors beyond directors' control
- AMs may still out-earn directors in 2026 if profit sharing is modest

**Best for:** If you want to reward directors for profitability/efficiency, not just growth

## Recommended Hybrid Approach

After analyzing all options, here's a potential hybrid that balances fairness, simplicity, and cost:

### Tier 1: Account Managers (Individual Performance)
- **Cross-sell commissions:** 5% of contract value
- **Referral credits:** 5-10% tiered
- **Review credits:** $500 each
- **Earning potential:** $5-15k per AM

### Tier 2: Directors of Account Management (Team Performance)
- **Override commissions:** 1.5% on their team's cross-sells
  - If overseeing 3-4 AMs who collectively close $150k in contracts → ~$2,250
- **OR** Individual commission on cross-sells they personally identify and close (5% like AMs)
  - Use whichever is higher (not both)
- **Earning potential:** $2-5k per Director

### Tier 3: All Directors (Company Performance)
- **Quarterly MRR growth bonuses:**
  - Q2 2026: If MRR hits $320k (+$27k from Q1), directors split $8k pool = $2k each (4 directors)
  - Q3 2026: If MRR hits $345k (+$25k from Q2), directors split $8k pool = $2k each
  - Q4 2026: If MRR hits $370k (+$25k from Q3), directors split $12k pool = $3k each
  - **Total potential:** $7k per director if all quarterly targets hit
- **Alternative:** Year-end bonus if annual target hit ($5-10k per director)

### Tier 4: Supporting Roles (Contribution Recognition)
- **Director of Web Development:** $500 finder's fee for cross-sell opportunities logged in CRM and closed by AMs
  - Capped at 3 per year = $1,500 max
- **Director of Operations:** $3k bonus if annual churn improves to 25% or below (from 35%)

### Total Program Cost

**Account Manager Commissions:** $12-20k (original budget)
**Director Overrides:** $4-8k (1.5% on team cross-sells)
**Quarterly Director Bonuses:** $28k (if all targets hit)
**Contribution Bonuses:** $4.5k (Dev finder's fees + Ops churn bonus)

**Total: $48.5-60.5k investment**

**vs. Original Plan: $12-20k**

**Incremental cost: $28.5-40.5k to include directors**

## Questions for Co-Founders

Before finalizing the revised incentive structure, please consider:

### 1. Organizational Structure
- How many Directors of Account Management do you have?
- Do they actively manage client relationships or just coach AMs?
- Who typically leads QBRs and renewal conversations?

### 2. Client Communication
- Who should be making cross-sell pitches: AMs, Directors, or both?
- Who should be asking for referrals and reviews?
- How involved are directors in day-to-day client communication?

### 3. Budget and Priorities
- Is $48-60k total investment acceptable (vs. $12-20k AM-only)?
- If budget is tight, which roles are highest priority to incentivize?
- Would you rather keep it simple (AM-only) or inclusive (all directors)?

### 4. Fairness Philosophy
- Is it okay for AMs to potentially out-earn directors during the freeze?
- Do you view commissions as "sales comp" (only for client-facing) or "freeze relief" (everyone should benefit)?
- How important is it that all directors feel included in growth incentives?

### 5. Tracking and Attribution
- Do you have CRM capacity to track who identifies opportunities vs. who closes them?
- Are you comfortable with subjective decisions about who gets credit?
- Do you want strict rules or case-by-case co-founder approval?

## Next Steps

1. **Co-founders discuss and decide:**
   - Which option (or hybrid) best fits DYODE's culture and budget
   - Answer the questions above

2. **Define clear rules:**
   - Who can earn what, and for what specific contributions
   - Attribution and tracking requirements
   - Approval process for disputed commissions

3. **Update all strategy documents:**
   - Cross-sell strategy
   - Referral/review program
   - Rollout strategy
   - Executive summaries

4. **Communicate transparently:**
   - If some roles can't earn commissions, explain why clearly
   - If everyone has opportunities, make sure they understand their specific path
   - Avoid surprises or resentment

---

## Recommendation

**If budget allows:** Go with the **Hybrid Approach** (Tiers 1-4 above)
- Inclusive: Everyone has a path to earn
- Fair: Rewards align with contributions
- Motivating: Multiple ways to win

**If budget is tight:** Go with **Option 2** (AM commissions + Director overrides)
- Keeps primary focus on AMs doing the work
- Includes Directors of Account Management (who likely oversee the strategy)
- Simpler to track and administer
- Still excludes Dev/Ops directors, but total cost is manageable

**If simplicity is paramount:** Stick with **Option 1** (AM-only)
- Clearest and simplest
- Acknowledge upfront that client-facing roles have unique earning opportunity
- Consider year-end profit sharing for directors if company hits goals

**Our take:** The Hybrid Approach is worth the extra $28-40k investment because:
1. It prevents resentment during a difficult salary freeze
2. It aligns the entire leadership team toward growth
3. It encourages cross-functional collaboration (Dev spotting marketing needs, Ops improving retention)
4. $48-60k investment for $209k in new MRR is still an excellent ROI (4:1)
