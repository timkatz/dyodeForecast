# Client Referral & Review Incentive Program

**Created:** November 2025
**Purpose:** Drive client referrals and Clutch reviews through credit-based incentive program

---

## Executive Summary

**Why This Matters:**
- **Client referrals** have 60-80% close rates (vs. 25-35% for other channels)
- **Clutch reviews** drive 30-40% of inbound leads for agencies
- **Referral CAC** is $0-500 vs. $5,000+ for Martal-sourced leads
- **Social proof** is critical for closing high-value Shopify Plus clients

**Program Structure:**
- **Clutch Review:** $500 service credit
- **Client Referral:** 5-10% of first contract value in service credits
- Credits apply to future invoices, never cash

**2026 Goals:**
- **Reviews:** 10-15 new Clutch reviews in 2026
- **Referrals:** 5-8 client referrals converting to deals
- **ROI:** 20-30x return on credit investment

---

## Part 1: Clutch Review Incentive Program

### Overview

**Incentive:** $500 service credit for qualified Clutch reviews

**Why $500:**
- Meaningful enough to motivate action ($50 feels cheap, $1,000+ too expensive)
- ~1-2 weeks of typical retainer value (shows appreciation)
- Low cost to acquire social proof (10 reviews = $5k vs. months of inbound value)

**Target:** 10-15 new reviews in 2026

---

### Eligibility Requirements

**Who Qualifies:**
- ✅ Current active clients (retainer or project)
- ✅ Past clients who worked with DYODE in last 24 months
- ✅ Relationship duration: minimum 3 months of work

**Review Requirements:**
- Must be published on **Clutch** (not G2, Trustpilot, etc.)
- Minimum 4 stars (out of 5)
- Substantive review (minimum 100 words)
- Specific examples or details (not generic "great to work with")
- Honest feedback (negative points are okay if balanced)

**What Doesn't Qualify:**
- ❌ Reviews less than 4 stars
- ❌ Generic/short reviews (<100 words)
- ❌ Reviews without specifics
- ❌ Incentivized-sounding reviews (avoid "I was paid to write this")
- ❌ Duplicate reviews from same client/person

---

### How It Works

**Step 1: Client Submits Review**
- Client submits review directly on Clutch
- Clutch verifies the review (typically 3-5 business days)
- Review goes live on DYODE's Clutch profile

**Step 2: Notify DYODE**
- Client emails DYODE: "I just left a Clutch review"
- Include link to review (or Clutch will notify DYODE automatically)

**Step 3: Credit Applied**
- DYODE verifies review meets requirements
- $500 credit applied to next invoice
- Confirmation email sent to client

**Timeline:** 7-10 business days from review submission to credit

---

### Credit Mechanics

**Credit Value:** $500

**How Credit Works:**
- Applied to next invoice(s) after review is verified
- Can be split across multiple invoices if balance remains
- Credits never expire (as long as client is active)
- Non-transferable, non-refundable
- Cannot be exchanged for cash

**Example:**
- Client has $10,000/month retainer
- Leaves Clutch review → earns $500 credit
- Next invoice: $9,500 (after $500 credit)

---

---

## Part 2: Client Referral Incentive Program

### Overview

**Incentive:** 5-10% of first contract value in service credits

**Why This Structure:**
- Scales with deal size (bigger deals = bigger reward)
- Credit-based keeps clients engaged with DYODE
- More generous than typical $500-1,000 flat referral bonuses
- Lower cost than sales commissions (5-10% vs. 10-15%)

**Target:** 5-8 referrals converting to deals in 2026

---

### Incentive Tiers

| New Client Contract Value | Referrer Credit | Example |
|---------------------------|-----------------|---------|
| $15,000 - $29,999 (3-6mo contract) | **5%** | $20k contract → $1,000 credit |
| $30,000 - $49,999 | **7%** | $40k contract → $2,800 credit |
| $50,000 - $74,999 | **8%** | $60k contract → $4,800 credit |
| $75,000+ | **10%** | $90k contract → $9,000 credit |

**Why Tiered:**
- Incentivizes higher-value referrals
- Rewards clients who refer premium opportunities
- Fair compensation for effort

---

### Eligibility Requirements

**Who Can Refer:**
- ✅ Current active clients
- ✅ Past clients (within 24 months)
- ✅ Unlimited referrals (no cap)

**What Qualifies as a Referral:**
- Client introduces DYODE to a brand
- Introduction leads to signed contract
- Referrer is credited as source in CRM
- Contract is executed within 6 months of intro

**What Doesn't Qualify:**
- ❌ Leads already in DYODE pipeline
- ❌ Brands that contacted DYODE directly (not through referrer)
- ❌ Referrals that don't sign a contract
- ❌ Clients who sign but churn within 60 days (clawback)

---

### How It Works

**Step 1: Client Makes Introduction**
- Client emails/introduces DYODE to prospective brand
- Client notifies DYODE: "I'm referring [Brand Name]"
- DYODE logs referral in CRM with referrer credit

**Step 2: DYODE Engages Prospect**
- DYODE reaches out to prospect
- Sales process begins
- Referrer stays informed of progress (optional)

**Step 3: Contract Signed**
- New client signs contract
- DYODE calculates credit (5-10% of first contract value)
- Referrer receives notification

**Step 4: Credit Applied**
- Credit applied after new client's first invoice is paid (ensures contract is real)
- Credit appears on referrer's next invoice
- Confirmation email sent

**Timeline:** 30-90 days from referral to credit (depending on sales cycle)

---

### Credit Mechanics

**Credit Calculation:**
- Based on **first contract value** (not monthly MRR)
- Example: $10k/month x 6-month contract = $60k → 8% credit = $4,800

**How Credit Works:**
- Applied to invoices after new client's first payment clears
- Can be split across multiple invoices
- Credits expire after 24 months (encourages continued engagement)
- Non-transferable, non-refundable
- Cannot be exchanged for cash

**Stacking:**
- Can earn credits from multiple referrals
- Credits accumulate and apply sequentially
- No limit on total credits earned

**Example:**
- Client refers Brand A → $40k contract → $2,800 credit
- Client refers Brand B → $60k contract → $4,800 credit
- Total credits: $7,600 applied over next 7-8 months

---

### Referral Tiers & Recognition

**Annual Referral Tiers:**

| Tier | Referrals/Year | Bonus | Recognition |
|------|----------------|-------|-------------|
| **Advocate** | 1 referral | Standard credit | Thank you note |
| **Champion** | 2-3 referrals | +$500 bonus credit | Public thank you, exclusive event invite |
| **Partner** | 4+ referrals | +$1,500 bonus credit | Featured case study, priority support |

**Why Tiers:**
- Rewards repeat referrers
- Creates gamification/motivation
- Recognizes top advocates

### Impact on Marketing Budget

**Referral CAC vs. Other Channels:**

| Channel | Typical CAC | Close Rate | Time to Close |
|---------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| **Referrals** | $500-2,000 (credit) | 60-80% | 15-30 days |
| **Martal** | $5,000-7,000 | 30-40% | 30-60 days |
| **Inbound (Clutch)** | $2,000-4,000 | 40-50% | 30-45 days |
